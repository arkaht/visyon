            "Many events that may but have not yet occurred in games can be foreseen by players and give them experiences of [Hovering Closures](hovering-closures). These closures may be used by the players to plan their actions: players may intentionally try to increase the chances of [Hovering Closures](hovering-closures) that are perceived as positive or simply allowed to occur, while closures with negative consequences may be acted against.",

            "Auctions in games are examples of [Hovering Closures](hovering-closures) where one outcome is clearly perceived by the players, but this outcome can be changed by additional bids.",

        "usage": [
            "Designed [Hovering Closures](hovering-closures) can either be [Ultra-Powerful Events](ultra-powerful-events) or [Interruptible Actions](interruptible-actions) depending on whether players are supposed to have [Illusion of Influence](illusionof-influence) and a [Perceived Chance to Succeed](perceived-chanceto-succeed). The most common ways to create [Hovering Closures](hovering-closures) are [Delayed Reciprocity](delayed-reciprocity), various goals based upon [Symmetry](symmetry) or [Configuration](configuration), or [Extended Actions](extended-actions) with [Time Limits](time-limits). [Progress Indicators](progress-indicators) are explicit [Hovering Closures](hovering-closures), which are part of the game design.",
            "[Hovering Closures](hovering-closures) can either be created through the [Narrative Structure](narrative-structures) or through the game state. When part of the [Narrative Structure](narrative-structures), the [Hovering Closure](hovering-closures) is usually not affected by players but can give [Anticipation](anticipation), for example nearing the end of a [Level](levels). Regarding game state, [Hovering Closures](hovering-closures) can either be due to players observing [Predictable Consequences](predictable-consequences) from [The Show Must Go On](the-show-must-go-on) such as [Alignment](alignment) or due to players soon completing actions. These actions can either be those that fulfill [Continuous Goals](continuous-goals) or planned actions that cannot have been done earlier due to [Turn Taking](turn-taking)."

            "[Hovering Closures](hovering-closures) are caused by [Extended Actions](extended-actions) and events with [Delayed Effects](delayed-effects) that have [Predictable Consequence](predictable-consequences) s. The consequences do not have to be certain, but at least one outcome must be clearly perceivable, as for example is the case of perceiving the chance to win when [Betting](betting) and also in [Quick Games](quick-games) with single actions. [Hovering Closures](hovering-closures) can create [Emotional Immersion](emotional-immersion) and [Anticipation](anticipation) when the closures are related to players' success in the game or parts of the [Narrative Structure](narrative-structures). [Uncommitted Alliances](uncommitted-alliances) may be the result of the [Hovering Closure](hovering-closures) of one player being close to completing a goal or action that can be perceived by other players.",
            "[Surprises](surprises), being neither [Extended Actions](extended-actions) or predictable, cannot be [Hovering Closures](hovering-closures) and may destroy existing ones."
