        "definition": "That one or more player controls the process of distributing between several players the rewards for completing, or the penalties for failing, a goal.",
        "description": [
            "Games may allow players to have influence over how the distribution of rewards or penalties is performed. This [Player-Decided Distribution of Rewards & Penalties](player-decided-distributionof-rewards-penalties) may let one or a few players chose between being fair leaders or egoistic despots and can cause intense negotiation between players."
        ],
        "examples": [
            "the board game \"Junta\" allows the players who is \"El Presidente\" to divide the foreign aid received between players in any manner he or she chooses, regardless of any promises.",
            "the division of treasure and magic items in roleplaying games is usually a heated discussion between players based on effort and risks taken to get the loot as well as potential use of the found items.",
            "in \"Drachengold\" players find treasures but do only get to keep them if they can agree on how they should be distributed between the players within a limit amount of time."
        ],
        "usage": [
            "The two main design choices regarding [Player-Decided Distribution of Rewards & Penalties](player-decided-distributionof-rewards-penalties) are who affects the distribution and what restrictions to the distribution exist. The two common ways for players to be able to affect the distribution is through [Privileged Abilities](privileged-abilities) or through [Bidding](bidding), which in the later case may require certain [Resources](resources) and these [Resources](resources) may influence the vote in various degrees depending on their values. Typically options when designing [Player-Decided Distribution of Rewards & Penalties](player-decided-distributionof-rewards-penalties) are how to divide [Shared Rewards](shared-rewards) or [Shared Penalties](shared-penalties), but also to assign [Individual Penalties](individual-penalties) within a group.",
            "Putting some restrictions on the distribution is mainly to ensure that [Symmetric Resource Distribution](symmetric-resource-distribution) at some level is done, or that all players receive a minimum level from the available [Renewable Resources](renewable-resources), or to make [Social Status](social-statuses) have explicit effects on gameplay. However, restrictions lessen players' [Freedom of Choice](freedomof-choice) and lessen the impact of [Betrayal](betrayal)."
        ],
        "consequences": [
            "[Player-Decided Distribution of Rewards & Penalties](player-decided-distributionof-rewards-penalties) are a form of [Player Decided Results](player-decided-results) which increases players' [Freedom of Choice](freedomof-choice) and creates the potential for [Tension](tension). They make the process of [Rewards](rewards) into one where [Negotiation](negotiation) takes place as where [Betrayal](betrayal) of [Uncommitted Alliances](uncommitted-alliances) can take place. When the distribution or effects of the [Rewards](rewards) and [Penalties](penalties) have [Imperfect Information](imperfect-information), the tension causes by [Player-Decided Distribution of Rewards & Penalties](player-decided-distributionof-rewards-penalties) is increased but the possibility of [Secret Alliances](secret-alliances) emerges.",
            "As these forms of [Rewards](rewards) can be [Shared Rewards](shared-rewards) they are typically given after the completion of [Mutual Goals](mutual-goals) or [Collaborative Actions](collaborative-actions), and are most common in games with [Team Play](team-play) or the possibility for [Dynamic Alliances](dynamic-alliances).",
            "Participating in actions affecting the events that initiate [Player-Decided Distribution of Rewards & Penalties](player-decided-distributionof-rewards-penalties) is a [Risk/Reward](risk-reward) choice. First, participating in making the events occur may require [Resources](resources) and risks without being compensated if it is successful and give [Penalties](penalties) if the events are part of [Committed Goals](committed-goals). Second, actively working against the event occurring can significantly raise the chances of getting any [Penalties](penalties) if the event occurs without any chance of getting the [Rewards](rewards). Being neutral lessens the risk of receiving [Penalties](penalties) but typically also gives little chance of receiving [Rewards](rewards) either. As all [Player Decided Results](player-decided-results) they have few [Predictable Consequences](predictable-consequences) but also give players [Limited Planning Abilities](limited-planning-ability).",
            "Letting players affect the distribution of [Rewards](rewards) and [Penalties](penalties) can have [Balancing Effects](balancing-effects) when players in overall advantageous situations cannot benefit themselves or when mainly [Penalties](penalties) are assigned. When several players affect the distribution this allows them to gang up against perceived leaders and the risk of disrupting [Player Balance](player-balance) is lessened.",
            "When the [Rewards](rewards) or [Penalties](penalties) distributed affect [Resources](resources), the act of choosing how the distribution of [Resources](resources) should be made is one of [Resource Management](resource-management) and requires [Tradeoff](tradeoffs) decisions to be made. [Player-Decided Distribution of Rewards & Penalties](player-decided-distributionof-rewards-penalties) typically results in [Asymmetric Resource Distribution](asymmetric-resource-distribution) but can promote [Symmetric Resource Distribution](symmetric-resource-distribution) within the subgroup of players who decided the choice of distribution.",
            "[Player-Decided Distribution of Rewards & Penalties](player-decided-distributionof-rewards-penalties) may be the effect of dividing [Rewards](rewards) from a [Tied Results](tied-results). However, the knowledge that one can have [Player-Decided Distribution of Rewards & Penalties](player-decided-distributionof-rewards-penalties) can modulate players' behaviors so that agree on reaching a [Tied Result](tied-results)."
