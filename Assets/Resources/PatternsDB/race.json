        "description": [
            "In the context of classical board games, David Parlett [Parlett99] classifies \"Race\" s as being games concerned with being the first to get all pieces back home by traversing a linear track in as few turns as possible, using \"Ludo\" and \"Backgammon\" as examples. Modern board games, for example \"RoboRally\", show examples of how \"Races\" can be expanded to include free movement on two-dimensional game areas. Computer-based racing games such as \"F-Zero GX\" or \"Mario Kart Double Dash!!\" allow players freedom of movement along the width of the track, and sometimes divide the track into several different tracks that offer different difficulties and advantages.",
            "Although the most common type of \"Race\" is the one where players try to reach a specific location or place by moving, a \"Race\" does not need to depend on a spatial goal. Other possibilities include being the first to gain a competence or arranging game elements in a certain order. More generally in a \"Race\", the players try to reach, or achieve, a certain game state before other players."
        ],
        "examples": [
            "In \"Race\" s using a linear track, 100 meter dash for example, these winning conditions of the race are easy to describe: the goal game state is to be the first person to physically pass a certain distance marker, and this is to be achieved by running.",
            "The winning condition in \"Pig\" (a simple dice game) is to be the first one to \"Score\" a predefined amount of points.",
            "The collectable card game \"ShadowRun\" uses points; each successfully completed mission gives players points, the number depending on the difficulty level of the mission.",
            "\"Golf\" can be seen as a kind of \"Race\". The players try to go through the track in as little game time as possible (bearing in mind that game time in \"Golf\" is measured by the amount of strokes)."
        ],
        "usage": [
            "\"Race\" is a high-level goal that always requires the use of underlying goals to fill in the details of exactly what game state the players are trying to achieve and how the players can proceed to that game state. The most direct type of underlying goal for \"Race\" is \"Traverse\", which is the traditional form of a \"Race\", but by using \"Score\", most forms of subgoals can be used to form \"Races\". When several people can complete \"Gain Competence\" goals or have \"Excluding Goals\" that can be fulfilled at certain locations, this can take the form of a \"Race\" that is a \"Supporting Goal\". Players starting with \"Shared Resources\" with players can exploit to gain \"Individual Rewards\" for \"Races\" between the players, for example, claiming \"Area Control\" of a previously unclaimed area through \"Exploration\".",
            "The end of a \"Race\" can be determined in several ways. The completion of an underlying goal, with \"Traverse\" as the prime candidate, can be used to determine the end of a \"Race\", but the use of \"Time Limit\" makes the \"Race\" a matter of distance rather than of speed. By measuring the duration of activities to determine progress, typically by \"Score\", \"Races\" can become \"Continuous Goals\" that typically go on until a specific resource, typically fuel or \"Lives\", has been depleted from all players.",
            "Players' feelings of participation in a \"Race\" depend heavily on whether they know their position in relationship to the other players. This requires that players have a certain \"Game State Overview\" so they can have a \"Perceived Chance to Succeed\", typically \"Progress Indicators\" show the progress of all players, but \"Status Indicators\" can be used for \"Races\" with \"Continuous Goals\". However, if players can perceive that they have very little chance of improving their position, the \"Race\" loses its \"Tension\". To avoid this, one can add a \"Balancing Effect\" to the game so that trailing players are given various advantages.",
            "The evaluation of who wins a \"Race\" when two or more players complete it simultaneously can either be done with a \"Tiebreaker\" or allow for \"Tied Results\". Using a \"Tiebreaker\" increases the \"Tension\" and forces \"Individual Rewards\" while \"Tied Results\" make \"Shared Rewards\" possible.",
            "Racing games that are \"Real-Time Games\" commonly use convoluted and winding tracks to add the extra dimension of having to \"Maneuver\", making \"Strategic Knowledge\" of the \"Game World\" valuable. Requiring players to \"Maneuver\" makes skills in \"Dexterity-Based Actions\" important and brings in tactical \"Risk/Reward\" decisions of how fast the player is willing to speed down a track in relation to his skill.",
            "It is possible to apply \"Race\" in almost any kind of game by introducing time as the determining factor of an outcome. All players do not have to start the \"Race\" at the same time, making \"Races\" possible in both \"Asynchronous Games\" and \"Synchronous Games\", as the prime requirements of a \"Race\" are that the goals are the same for all players and that the starting conditions are equivalent, with the possible modification of \"Handicaps\". The use of \"Ghosts\" allows for the creation of \"Meta Games\" that are \"Asynchronous Games\" based on merging a game instance with a recorded instance.",
            "Some games, however, are better suited for \"Races\" than others, because there are natural possibilities for players to evaluate the distance between their current position, the goal, and the other players' relative positions. The accuracy of this relative position information may change over time varying the player's \"Anticipation\" and \"Tension\" levels as well as supporting \"Player Defined Goals\". For example, in many racing games players have direct access to the relative position information if other cars are within the field of vision. Otherwise, they have to rely on a track diagram, which gives \"Imperfect Information\" through a \"Game State Overview\". When an opponent comes into sight, the goal of overtaking that player becomes significantly more present as the possibilities and progress of the goal become easier to perceive."

        "consequences": [
            "A \"Race\" gives players \"Symmetric Goals\" to strive towards. Further, if the players have means to judge their own progress and to know the progress of the other players through \"Progress Indicators\", a \"Race\" promotes \"Competition\" and creates a \"Conflict\" between the players. \"Races\" are usually \"Excluding Goals\" through the use of \"Tiebreakers\" although \"Tied Results\" allow for \"Shared Rewards\".",
            "Traditional \"Races\" give rise to \"Movement\" in games and are modulated by \"Movement Limitations\" of individual players or effects of the environment."
