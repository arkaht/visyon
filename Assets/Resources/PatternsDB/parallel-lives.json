        "definition": "Parallel Lives are used in games where the player controls or protects several game elements which each can be considered to have a life of its own.",
        "description": [
            "The loss of one of these elements may limit the players' possible actions or opportunities but does not have as severe consequences as the loss of a life of a player character, which typically signifies the end of a game session or forces the players to restart at an earlier point in the game."
        ],
        "examples": [
            "\"Missile Command\" is an archetypical example of [Parallel Lives](parallel-lives): the player has six cities that all can be destroyed and the player can continue playing as long as at least one city is intact."
        ],
        "usage": [
            "The design choices associated with [Parallel Lives](parallel-lives) are similar to those of [Lives](lives) but the [Penalties](penalties) of losing a parallel life is usually small, typically only the loss of the actions the [Units](units) provided. However, not all [Units](units) need to be valued the same in order to create a hierarchy of importance; the lose of some may allow continued gameplay while others must be kept alive, at least until certain events have taken place,. The consequences of losing all [Parallel Lives](parallel-lives) are typically the same as losing all [Lives](lives) in an [Avatar](avatars) -based game of [Player Elimination](player-elimination)."
        ],
        "consequences": [
            "[Parallel Lives](parallel-lives) require players to make Risk/Reward calculations on which game elements to protect and which to risk. The pattern often requires the players to perform [Attention Swapping](attention-swapping), especially in games where players do not have a complete overview of the [Game World](game-world). The use of [Parallel Lives](parallel-lives) is problematic to combine with that of [Avatars](avatars)."
