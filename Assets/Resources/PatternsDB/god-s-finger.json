        "definition": "A God's Finger is a game element that allows the player to affect the game world, but which cannot be affected by events in the game world itself.",
        "description": [],
        "examples": [
            "many real-time strategy games make use of a \"God's Finger\" in the form of a cursor that is used to select individual units or groups. Similarly, the \"Sims\" makes use of a cursor to let players move between the different characters in the game and to manipulate the game world.",
            "the cursor in god-game \"Black &amp; White\" is literally a \"God's Finger\"."
        ],
        "usage": [
            "The simplest use of a \"God's Finger\" is to let players navigate the \"Game World\" to select the \"Units\" they wish to use. However, a \"God's Finger\" can act as a \"Focus Loci\" for actions that are independent of \"Units\" or to specify the effect areas of ranged actions, for example, by selecting an area by stating its boundaries. Often the \"God's Finger\" is outside the \"Consistent Reality Logic\" of the game but exceptions are possible, e. g. through using spirits and possessions."
        ],
        "consequences": [
            "A \"God's Finger\" lets the players navigate the game world regardless of where their \"Avatars\" and \"Units\" are. By doing so, they may limit the use of \"Surprises\" and the feeling of \"Immersion\" as the \"God's Finger\" does not typically provide a point of identificationfor the player and is outside the \"Consistent Reality Logic\" of the game."
