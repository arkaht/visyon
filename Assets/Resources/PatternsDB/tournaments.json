        "definition": "Tournaments consist of the playing of a series of game instances where the outcome of each instances affects the outcome of the whole tournament.",
        "description": [
            "By making each of a number of games count toward a common score, virtually any kind of game or games can be made into [Tournaments](tournaments). [Tournaments](tournaments) also allow several players to compete in teams even if the individual games do not allow teams, and [Tournaments](tournaments) may also let more players test their skills against each other than is possible in a single game session. Usually all participants in a [Tournament](tournaments), either on a team level or an individual player level, are part of the [Tournament](tournaments) from the beginning, and changes to the team composition are not allowed as long as the [Tournament](tournaments) continues.",
            "Some games, particularly games of chance, are played in [Tournaments](tournaments) where several game instances are completed within a single play session. These games have a short playing time for each instance, and the skill required is most often based on outwitting or outguessing other players' strategies or simply on luck."
        ],
        "examples": [
            "In \"Poker\", each round is one game instance and, for most people, playing only one round is quite meaningless. That is why \"Poker\" is very often played in a [Tournament](tournaments), such as the \"Poker\" night, where the outcome is to win money from the other players and to gain insight into the other players' ways of playing \"Poker\".",
            "\"TransAmerica\" is a board game where the goal for each round is to be the first player to connect five American cities with railroad tracks, and the players who still have unconnected cities lose points based on how many tracks are missing from connecting the cities. The cities to be connected are different for each player and they are kept secret from the other players. The [Tournament](tournaments) ends when one of the players has lost a certain amount of points.",
            "The world cup in \"Soccer\" is a [Tournament](tournaments) using elimination of the other teams for determining the final winner. The teams are eliminated from the [Tournament](tournaments) on the basis of losing single game instances to other teams, and the last team left in play is the winner."
        ],
        "usage": [
            "The primary design choice of a [Tournament](tournaments), of course, concerns what games the [Tournament](tournaments) should consist of. Usually this is one game played several different times, either with the same or a different composition of players, but [Tournaments](tournaments) consisting of other [Tournaments](tournaments) are also possible, as are[Polyathlons](polyathlons). If the different events where players compete against each other are sufficiently separate, [Last Man Standing](last-man-standing) can be seen as a [Tournament](tournaments) (as in the game \"Unreal Tournament\"). Common uses of the [Tournament](tournaments) structure within [Multiplayer Games](multiplayer-games) can be found when [Betting](betting) or[Combat](combat) activities occur.",
            "Whatever the choice of games (or sub-tournaments) for the [Tournament](tournaments), the results from them must by quantifiable so that they can be incorporated into the state of the [Tournament](tournaments). This is usually done by [Eliminate](eliminate) where the loss of a game means that one is out of the [Tournament](tournaments), or by using a [Score](score) system to postpone the consequences of individual games to a later point. The mapping between the outcome of a single game instance and the final outcome of he [Tournament](tournaments) can be as simple as a one-to-one mapping between victories and points to more complex systems to influence the way individual games are played, e. g., giving three points for a victory and one point for a draw to penalize safe tactics. The use of [Score](score) systems can however make the consequences of individual game instances into [Illusionary Rewards](illusionary-rewards) since the overall outcome of a [Tournament](tournaments) can already be evident. In [Self-Facilitated Games](self-facilitated-games), [Tournaments](tournaments) can spontaneously occur as players may ask for rematches in the form of best-of-three suggestions.",
            "Although [Tournaments](tournaments) typically use [Tiebreakers](tiebreakers), they can also instantiate them, for example by consisting of uneven number of played games. Playing a game two times in a row but swapping players roles can create [Player Balance](player-balance) in games with [Asymmetric Abilities](asymmetric-abilities). In these cases the overall [Tiebreaker](tiebreakers), given that all players won using the same role in the game, is usually to compare the margin by which the winning role won.",
            "[Tournaments](tournaments) have either mechanistic or random ways of determining in which order the different game instances will be played. However, the medieval tournaments show the possibility of letting participants influence what game instances are played in which order by allowing them to challenge other participants, in effect using a form of [Selectable Sets of Goals](selectable-setsof-goals) in [Self-Facilitated Games](self-facilitated-games)."
        ],
        "consequences": [
            "[Tournaments](tournaments) are [Meta Games](meta-games) that have [Overcome](overcome) goals and thereby include [Conflict](conflict). They rarely allow [Tied Result](tied-results) by design, and typically repeat or prolong the underlying activity as a way to create an initial [Tiebreaker](tiebreakers). Since [Tournaments](tournaments) consist of several different game instances, they give [Replayability](replayability) to games automatically and give extra potential for [Tension](tension) between the actual game sessions. They can be used to achieve [Perceivable Margins](perceivable-margins) on which player has [Game Mastery](game-mastery) since elements of [Randomness](randomness) can be removed due to repetition.",
            "[Tournaments](tournaments) can be used for two main purposes: either to support the participation of more players than one instance of the game can handle or to remove the influence of [Luck](luck) or temporary variation in performance of players in order to create [Perceivable Margins](perceivable-margins). In the first case, it is common to use [Eliminate](eliminate) to reduce the number of players as the tournament progresses, which can imply [Higher-Level Closures as Gameplay Progresses](higher-level-closuresas-gameplay-progresses). This form of [Tournaments](tournaments) can be combined with allowing [Team Play](team-play) that does not exist in the individual games by defining teams across the game sessions. The second case usually does not use [Eliminate](eliminate), since it is common to want the same players to meet each other several times, allowing them to build [Strategic Knowledge](strategic-knowledge). The second case is common in [Overcome](overcome) goals but [Tournaments](tournaments) can also be used to create [Meta Games](meta-games) with [Overcome](overcome) goalsconsisting of winning any sort of goal more times than the other players do.",
            "Since [Tournaments](tournaments) consist of undividable or atomic components, the completion of each game instance is a [Closure Point](closure-points) from which only a small amount of [Trans-Game Information](trans-game-information) is passed on to the [Tournament](tournaments). As this provides a means of distributing the activity both in time and space, a [Tournament](tournaments) allows players not to have to participate in all events of a [Tournament](tournaments) while still being full participants. The [Tournament](tournaments) structure used in a single play session with [Quick Games](quick-games) is at least based partly on [Luck](luck), which allows for closures of success and failure to virtually all players.",
            "[Tournaments](tournaments) demand stronger long term commitment to the game itself, making the necessary skills of the game more valuable. However, they may also support the distribution of the activity in time, allowing skills and tactics to develop during the progress of the tournament. The use of [Spectators](spectators) is common in [Tournaments](tournaments), since [Tournaments](tournaments) function as focal points of interest for a particular game. These characteristics can also create and maintain stable [Social Organizations,](social-organizations) such as \"Soccer\" clubs, around the game itself."
