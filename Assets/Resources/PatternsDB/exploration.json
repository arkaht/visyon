        "description": [
            "In games where the whole [Game World](game-world) is not know at the beginning of the game, it is often advantageous to try and acquire this knowledge during gameplay. Typically examples of this use of [Exploration](exploration) can be found in real-time strategy games, first-person shooters, and roleplaying games."

        "examples": [
            "Games in the \"Civilization\" series start with the players knowing very little about the [Game World](game-world). A prerequisite for being able to plan on a higher level against the other players or how to expand one's civilization depends on completing as much [Exploration](exploration) of the world as possible."
        ],
        "usage": [
            "The definition of an [Exploration](exploration) goal is by its nature fuzzy. The player is given the task that there is something important to find in an unknown territory in the [Game World](game-world), either specific game elements or [Strategic Locations](strategic-locations), but the exact locations of the [Goal Points](goal-points) are not known. However, the exact nature of what is to be found does not have to be explicitly known either, giving game designers two different options for [Surprises](surprises). [Exploration](exploration) often makes use of [Supporting Goals](supporting-goals) that provide partial information of how to find the main goal of the search.",
            "For [Exploration](exploration) to be used, games need to provide a form of [Movement](movement) in the game space that in non-linear, so that a player has to decide in which direction to explore. That said, the area to be explored may be predetermined or be created using [Randomness](randomness) or a game board constructed by another player. The latter supports [Replayability](replayability) while the former can more easily provide a [Narrative Structure](narrative-structures) or [Surprises](surprises).",
            "[Resources](resources), [Outstanding Features](outstanding-features), [Obstacles](obstacles),[Traces](traces), and [Clues](clues) are typically used in designing the [Game World](game-world) to support [Exploration](exploration) and give points of reference. [Enemies](enemies) and [Deadly Traps](deadly-traps) are also commonly used to provide [Optional Goals](optional-goals) or increase the [Tension](tension) at certain points. [Easter Eggs](easter-eggs) are special cases that provide extra-game rewardsfor [Exploration](exploration). The design of the area in which the [Exploration](exploration) goal is situated can be postponed by using [Tile-Laying](tile-laying) to create the [Game World](game-world) as it is being explored.",
            "Common reasons for [Exploration](exploration) besides explicitly given goals are the known existences of [Secret Resources](secret-resources), for example, [Resources](resources) needed to perform [Construction](construction) actions\".\" When these [Resources](resources) are also [Shared Resources](shared-resources), they put players in [Races](race) against each other. The use of [Levels](levels) guarantees a form of [Exploration](exploration) goal, since the unvisited [Levels](levels) are unexplored areas. The knowledge that [Resource Generators](resource-generators) exist is a motivation for [Exploration](exploration) in real-time strategy games."

        "consequences": [
            "[Exploration](exploration) is movement in the [Game World](game-world) with the aim of finding game elements or charting the [Game World](game-world). It requires [Game World Navigation](game-world-navigation) and [Memorizing](memorizing) the layout unless some [Game State Overview](game-state-overview) shows the already-explored areas. As [Exploration](exploration) relies upon the environment being unknown to players, it gives players [Limited Foresight](limited-foresight) and can be used to create [Surprises](surprises). The possibility of [Surprises](surprises), the feeling of discovering new places, and [Illusionary Rewards](illusionary-rewards) in the form of aesthetically pleasing [Outstanding Features](outstanding-features) can all give players [Emotional Immersion](emotional-immersion).",
            "[Exploration](exploration) is a special case of combining [Traverse](traverse) and [Gain Information](gain-information) and, like the latter, requires either [Imperfect Information](imperfect-information) or [Uncertainty of Information](uncertaintyof-information). [Exploration](exploration) differs from [Reconnaissance](reconnaissance) in that the places, areas, and area boundaries are not known and the player has to get more information about them when there is [Fog of War](fogof-war). [Exploration](exploration) can be used to move players into new game spaces, either to provide [Varied Gameplay](varied-gameplay) by the novelty of the area or provide [Surprises](surprises) to put the player at a disadvantage, e. g., by the lack of knowledge of [Strategic Location](strategic-locations) s.",
            "[Single-Player Games](single-player-games) that support [Exploration](exploration) through [Easter Eggs](easter-eggs) and other [Optional Goals](optional-goals) offers players the opportunity to trade knowledge between game instances."
