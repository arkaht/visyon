        "definition": "Strategic Locations are areas in the Game World that give an advantage to the players controlling them.",
        "description": [
            "Their value can be that they contain game elements that allow certain actions or resources unavailable elsewhere, or that they control the access to other areas of the [Game World](game-world)."

        "examples": [
            "The player who controls the center of the game board in \"Chess\", especially with officers, has a significant strategic advantage.",
            "Controlling locations that produce valuable resources, such as the cities in \"Civilization\", provide the player a long-term strategic advantage."
        ],
        "usage": [
            "[Strategic Locations](strategic-locations) may be either explicit by the presence of game elements or implicit deriving from the relationship between the location and other locations in the game. Explicit [Strategic Locations](strategic-locations) can easily be created by the placement of [Resource Generators](resource-generators), [Resource Locations](resource-locations), [Chargers](chargers), [Tiles](tiles),[Pick-Ups](pick-ups), [Power-Ups](power-ups), [Controllers](controllers), [Safe Havens](safe-havens), [Spawn Points](spawn-points), and [Goal Points](goal-points). To ensure players' awareness of [Strategic Locations](strategic-locations), they can be set to stand out in the visual design of the [Game World](game-world) as [Outstanding Features](outstanding-features). Implicit [Strategic Locations](strategic-locations) may be intentionally created by the arrangement of explicit [Strategic Locations](strategic-locations) nearby, or they may be emergent features due to [Randomness](randomness) of[Resource](resources) allocation or due to the combinations of player strategies. In either case, [Strategic Locations](strategic-locations) can affect [Player Balance](player-balance), typically by giving advantages in [Combat](combat).",
            "Games using player constructed boards from [Tiles](tiles) allow the players to modify the value of explicit [Strategic Locations](strategic-locations) by placing them in positions where their relationship to other [Tiles](tiles) increase or decrease their usability. Similarly, [Tiles](tiles) with no inherent value can be made [Strategic Locations](strategic-locations) by connecting them to other [Tiles](tiles) in a certain way.",
            "A player might [Gain Information](gain-information) about [Strategic Locations](strategic-locations) as a [Supporting Goal](supporting-goals) with [Traverse](traverse), [Guard](guard), or [Reconnaissance](reconnaissance). It can be the primary subgoal in goals of [Exploration](exploration). Knowing [Strategic Locations](strategic-locations) can also influence [Spawning](spawning), if players have control over which [Spawn Points](spawn-points) to use."
        ],
        "consequences": [
            "Knowing and [Memorizing](memorizing) the proper value and use of [Strategic Locations](strategic-locations) is one way for the players to gain [Strategic Knowledge](strategic-knowledge) in a game, for example, in [Traverse](traverse) goals. This is especially true for [Strategic Locations](strategic-locations) that depend mainly on the topology of the surrounding [Game World](game-world) for their values, rather than on the explicit presence of valuable game elements. An example of how topology dictates that value of a location is the value of the central area of the board in \"Chess\". If the locations can be owned in the game, [Strategic Locations](strategic-locations) make excellent [Gain Ownership](gain-ownership) goals that can be achieved through [Area Control](area-control) or other actions that provide [Ownership](ownership) of parts of the [Game World](game-world)."
