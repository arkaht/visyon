    "texts": {
        "definition": "Effects from actions or events that can lead to negative consequences.",
        "description": [
            "\"Damage\" is an indication that players have failed to avoid the actions of enemies or dangerous objects in the game. The effects of \"Damage\" in most games are minor; it is mainly used as an indicator of how many times one may fail in a certain manor before more serious effects occur."
        ],
        "examples": [
            "Few first-person shooters make all hits instantaneous kills. Rather they require players to succeed with shots or strikes several times, each one giving \"Damage\", before killing their opponents.",
            "Roleplaying games often have detailed rules for \"Damage\", dividing character's bodies into different hit areas and having different consequences for taking \"Damage\" in each area.",
            "In the board game \"RoboRally\" the first points of \"Damage\" reduced the number of cards received each round. However, more \"Damage\" makes some cards be repeated each turn and severely limit the possible actions each turn. Even more \"Damage\" destroys the robot."
        ],
        "usage": [
            "Designing a \"Damage\" effect consists of determining what type of \"Damage\" is caused, how the severity of the \"Damage\" is calculated, how much accumulated \"Damage\" is needed before additional effects take place, if players can affect the severity of a \"Damage\", and if \"Damages\" can be healed or repaired. If the \"Damage\" comes as an effect of a \"Surprise\", the severity of the \"Surprise\" is increased but players \"Illusion of Influence\" may be negatively affected.",
            "The most common type of \"Damage\" is simply a reduction of a health, hit points, or armor \"Resource\". Additional effects such as forced \"Downtime\" and reduced \"Skills\", or other \"Ability Losses\", can be used to create other types of \"Damage\", but these are often reserved for special hits. Independent of how the \"Damage\" was caused its numerical values can either be fixed or be determined by a function. Fixed \"Damage\" values give \"Predictable Consequences\" while function can be used to create \"Randomness\" and increase the potential interest for each time \"Damage\" is received.",
            "\"Damage\" allows modulation of \"Eliminate\" goals so that not one single successful attack eliminates an opponent but rather several successes are required. How much \"Damage\" can be received before more severe \"Penalties\" are inflicted modulates the \"Risk/Reward\" choices player do when determining if the risk of \"Damage\" is worth the potential \"Rewards\". Giving different \"Units\" different values for this breakpoint can be one dimension in creating \"Orthogonal Unit Differentiation\".",
            "Modulating damage by affecting where it is given can allow players to have an influence of the severity of \"Damage\". An example of this is the possibility to do instantaneous kills with head shots in many first-person shooters. If it is not obvious where to hit to inflict greater damage, this area is an \"Achilles' Heels\" and the information is \"Strategic Knowledge\".",
            "Player may also diminish or cancel the amount of \"Damage\" they receive by counter or pre-emptive actions. Examples of counter actions include using \"Privileged Abilities\" (most common in games with the special effect as \"Cards\") or performing blocking or parrying maneuvers. Examples of pre-emptive actions include gaining invulnerability or armor, both usually received as \"Privileged Abilities\" of \"Power-Ups\" or \"Pick-Ups\".",
            "The amount of \"Damage\" received is usually indicated by a \"Status Indicator\" in order for players to perceive the severity of the \"Damage\" and gain knowledge about what caused the \"Damage\".",
            "If \"Damages\" can be healed or repaired, they can make \"Resources\" such as health or armor into \"Renewable Resources\". The actual effect of healing or repairing offers the same design choices as for other \"Renewable Resources\"."
        ],
        "consequences": [
            "The possibility of \"Damage\" in games gives \"Tension\". \"Damage\" is a form of \"Penalty\" and usually has very \"Predictable Consequences\". The cause for receiving \"Damage\" is the most often due to failing to \"Evade\" the effects of \"Deadly Traps\" or \"Combat\". Less common reasons for \"Damage\" include not being the \"King of the Hill\" or making a \"Consumer\" perform actionswhere the resources used are described in terms of \"Damage\".",
            "Like \"Lives\", \"Damage\" can be seen as a measure of how many times one may fail avoiding bad effects in a game before a more severe \"Penalty\" is imposed. However, \"Damage\" works on a smaller scale and may have no effect on player's \"Freedom of Choice\" until the accumulated \"Damage\" is translated into another form of \"Penalty\", typically loss of \"Lives\" or the destruction of a \"Unit\". When \"Damage\" gives immediate effects, the most common types of effects are \"Ability Loss\", forced \"Downtime\", or \"Disruption of Focused Attention\"."
