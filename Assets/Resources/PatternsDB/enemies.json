    "texts": {
        "definition": "Enemies are avatars and units that hinder the players trying to complete the goals.",
        "description": [
            "Many games have game elements that portray people or monsters that try and hinder players' goals. These [Enemies](enemies) can actively resist players' intentions through actions or they can be an explanation for challenges or obstacles in the [Game World](game-world).",
            "<B>Example:</B> In \"Soul Calibur II\", the combat opponents are straightforward [Enemies](enemies), which try to hinder the players' progress in the game."
        ],
        "examples": [
            "With the exception of puzzles, most games include enemies. A typical example of an enemy, albeit initially unknown, is Ganon in \"The Legend of Zelda\", whose defeat is the plot of the game."
        ],
        "usage": [
            "The primary design choice when defining [Enemies](enemies) is how players can [Overcome](overcome) or [Evade](evade) them. There may be many ways to do this, which may change during gameplay, and players may have to complete several subgoals before having the chance to challenge the [Enemies](enemies) at all. Typical ways of overcoming [Enemies](enemies) are by \"Elimination\" (most often in the form of [Aim & Shoot](aim-shoot)), by permanently making [Interferable Goals](interferable-goals) impossible or by converting through succeeding with [Gain Ownership](gain-ownership) goals. Games that provide many [Enemies](enemies) can give them different abilities to support [Orthogonal Unit Differentiation](orthogonal-unit-differentiation), and thereby [Varied Gameplay](varied-gameplay), or vary the environment in which these [Enemies](enemies) are encountered.",
            "Another design choice is where in a [Level](levels) the [Enemies](enemies) are met. They may block paths to [Traverse](traverse) goal, which makes their appearance likely or guaranteed, they may be the objectives of [Reconnaissance](reconnaissance) goals, or may be [Surprises](surprises) in [Exploration](exploration) goals. In games requiring [Maneuvering](maneuvering) they can provide additional hazards that have to be actively avoided.",
            "Having the [Enemies](enemies) appear separated allows players to decide what [Enemies](enemies) to challenge first (which can be useful to counter [Orthogonal Unit Differentiation](orthogonal-unit-differentiation)), while having the [Enemies](enemies) appear together can modulate the [Right Level of Difficulty](right-levelof-difficulty) between different areas of the [Level](levels).",
            "The most challenging [Enemies](enemies) are other humans. Computer controlled [Agents](agents) can be made very challenging by using information or ultra-powerful abilities impossible for players to have, in principle, using [Ultra-Powerful Events](ultra-powerful-events), but this easily conflicts with players' [Perceived Chance to Succeed](perceived-chanceto-succeed). [Game Masters](game-masters) can more precisely modulate players' [Perceived Chance to Succeed](perceived-chanceto-succeed) not only on their actual chance to succeed but also what the players believe.",
            "The cause for enmity between the player and the [Enemies](enemies) can usually be described through a \"Goal/Preventing Goal\" pair. By using high-level goal pairs, the [Enemies](enemies) can be used as the main driving force for the [Narrative Structure](narrative-structures) of the game. Such an overarching goal can then be used to create numerous subgoals within a [Hierarchy of Goals](hierarchyof-goals): a [Collection](collection) of goals that consist of several duels, [Gain Information](gain-information) goals to gain the identity of the [Enemies](enemies) or their [Achilles' Heel](achilles-heels), [Overcome](overcome) to defeat the henchmen of the [Enemy](enemies), [Supporting Goals](supporting-goals) to find the [Tools](tools) for defeating the [Enemy](enemies), and so on. However, causes compatible with the [Consistent Reality Logic](consistent-reality-logic) need to be found to explain why these [Enemies](enemies) cannot be encountered early in the game.",
            "The difficulty of [Enemies](enemies) can be modulated by changing their [Skills](skills), giving them [Privileged Movement](privileged-movement), or changing their numbers. [Alarms](alarms) can be used to support [Enemies](enemies) and can motivate the introduction of move [Enemies](enemies) if the [Alarms](alarms) are tripped. If players can have [Identification](identification) with the [Enemies](enemies), it can create a form of [Social Dilemma](social-dilemmas) as can having to perform certain actions to [Overcome](overcome) the [Enemies](enemies). A special type of an [Enemy](enemies) is the [Boss Monster](boss-monsters), who is used to signify the final goal that has to be fulfilled to complete a [Level](levels)."
        ],
        "consequences": [
            "[Enemies](enemies) are the [Characters](characters) or [Avatars](avatars) of players that have [Preventing Goals](preventing-goals) or [Agents](agents) or [Units](units) controlled by [Dedicated Game Facilitators](dedicated-game-facilitators) or [Game Masters](game-masters). The presence of [Enemies](enemies) in [Game Worlds](game-world) causes [Tension](tension) and gives players motivation for [Overcome](overcome) goals, often through [Combat](combat). As such, they naturally cause [Conflict](conflict) or [Competition](competition) as they threaten to make the players lose [Lives](lives) or[Resources](resources) (working as a form of [Consumers](consumers)), or otherwise block the players' progress in the game.",
            "The appearance of [Enemies](enemies) are nearly always [Disruption of Focused Attention](disruptionof-focused-attention) events and can require [Attention Swapping](attention-swapping) when several different groups of [Enemies](enemies) exist. [Enemies](enemies) are often used to give the motivation for the unfolding of [Narrative Structures](narrative-structures) in games. When players can identify common [Enemies](enemies), this is usually a motivation for creating [Alliances](alliances)."
