        "definition": "The players are identified in the game instance, and sometimes between game instances, by short names or other at least somewhat unique identifiers.",
        "description": [
            "The players are often free to choose their own \"Handles\", unless there already are similar \"Handles\" in the game. The requirement of a unique identifier within a game instance is usually quite strict, even if the game system itself does not guarantee the uniqueness of the \"Handle\". The same applies to more persistent \"Handles\" between game instances."
        ],
        "examples": [
            "\"Asteroids\" and many, if not most, other arcade games have highscore lists where the players can leave their short nick-names if they perform well enough in the game. The players can enter any \"Handle\" in the highscore list, but it is often considered quite impolite to use the same \"Handle\" as someone else.",
            "online multiplayer first-person shooters let the players enter names for their avatars. These \"Handles\" are used to measure and compare the performance of the individual players and in team-oriented games also to identify the other team-members. The \"Handles\" are not necessarily persistent from the game system point of view, but often there are sometimes severe penalties for players who try to pose as other players."
        ],
        "usage": [
            "The \"Handles\" in many cases are just short free-form pieces of text but can be linked not only to players but to whole \"Characters\". The classic limit of three characters per \"Handle\" is sometimes still used in current arcade games. Games with predefined roles for the players can let the players select their \"Handles\" from a predefined list. In these cases the \"Handle\" is also used to identify the players' different roles and abilities in the game. Online games for children, such as \"ToonTown\", let the players compose their \"Handles\" from predefined list of words to avoid the possibility of obscene \"Handles\". \"Handles\" can carry also extra information about the players, for example, their \"Social Status\" or if they belong to a \"Social Organizations\" such as clans or guilds."
        ],
        "consequences": [
            "\"Handles\" are used to identify different players in cases where differentiation would otherwise be impossible or difficult. Besides supporting \"Team Play\", players are often willing to identify themselves in order to compare and show off their \"Game Mastery\" to other players and \"Spectators\" in games with quantifiable measurements of performance, such as \"Score\", in order to accrue \"Social Status\". \"Highscore Lists\" are a prime example of this use of \"Handles\", allowing players to compare the outcomes of their game instances with other players. These kinds of persistent \"Handles\" are used to carry \"Trans-Game Information\" between game instances.",
            "Another reason for persistent \"Handles\" is that the players can form more stable \"Social Organizations\" where the players may have different roles and responsibilities. \"Persistent Game Worlds\" almost have to have some methods of identifying the other players and \"Handles\" is the simplest one of these. \"Handles\" provide simple means for \"Identification\" within the game for the players and heightens the \"Emotional Immersion\"."
