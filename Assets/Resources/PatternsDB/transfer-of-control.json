        "definition": "When the influence over a game element is passed from one player to another.",
        "description": [
            "Many games let game elements, or the control over the actions they allow, shift between players. This \"Transfer of Control\" makes the ownership of game elements less sure in the game and provides players with goals of trying to change the ownership status of game elements."
        ],
        "examples": [
            "Trading in the board game \"Civilization\" allows players to collect series of a commodities, which can then be used to purchase advances.",
            "The special ability of \"Priests\" in \"Age of Empires\" is to transfer the control of enemy units to the player controlling the \"Priests\"."
        ],
        "usage": [
            "\"Resources\" are the most common type of game element that may shift between different players' control, followed by \"Tools\" and \"Units\". \"Transfer of Control\" also addressed which player has \"Area Control\" over various parts of the game board or world. \"Gain Ownership\" and \"Collection\" goals require \"Transfer of Control\" events to occur, but the \"Transfer of Control\" does not have to be between players; the control can go from being uncontrolled, or controlled by the game system, to a player or vice versa. \"Collecting\" is an activity that gives a player control over game elements that in most cases are not under any other player's control. \"Penalties\" of losing \"Resources\" or \"Tools\", and the \"Ability Losses\" these cause, are examples of \"Transfer of Control\" from players to an uncontrolled state.",
            "If the \"Transfer of Controls\" are \"Irreversible Actions\" and the\"Resources\" involved are \"Limited Resources\" or \"Non-Renewable Resources\", the action of transferring control defines a sort of \"Closure Point\". If \"Reversability\" of the control transversal is possible, either between players or between players and the game system, this makes the \"Resources\" used \"Renewable Resources\", as a \"Closed Economy\" exists.",
            "\"Transfer of Control\" can be modulated to encourage players to specialize in a few game element types or spread control over many types. \"Geometric Rewards for Investments\" encourage players to focus upon one or a few game elements, while \"Privileged Abilities\", \"Diminishing Returns\", and explicit heterogeneous \"Collections\" all favor wider spreads of control.",
            "The actions leading to \"Transfer of Control\" can either be based on \"Collaborative Actions\" or \"Conflict\" although the former can lead to the latter. \"Negotiation\" is an example that enables \"Collaborative Actions\" regarding control transfer through such actions as \"Trading\" or \"Bidding\". \"Betting\" is similar but lies closer to \"Conflict\". \"Overcome\" and \"Capture\" goals are pure examples of \"Conflict\" and are most often conducted through \"Combat\".",
            "\"Transfer of Control\" does not have to be total. By giving other players some control, the control can become shared and require \"Collaborative Actions\" such as \"Bidding\". Another form of making \"Transfer of Control\" less total is by introducing some form of reversed transfer. Examples of this occur naturally in \"Trading\" but may be enforced in \"Bidding\" by distributing the \"Resources\" used for the \"Betting\" to the players who do not win the bet. This form of reciprocal transfer usually has \"Balancing Effects\" but also allows players to have \"Strategic Knowledge\" about the difference in values between the transferred game elements or actions."
        ],
        "consequences": [
            "\"Transfer of Control\" provides means of changing \"Ownership\" of game elements during gameplay. This can provide \"Varied Gameplay\" for players, as it means that \"New Abilities\" or \"Privileged Abilities\" that are unavailable other times can be available for players. Depending on how the \"Transfer of Control\" can be done, the presence of the possibility of it gives rise to \"Negotiation\" or \"Conflict\". Both gaining control and losing control of game elements easily causes \"Emotional Immersion\"."
