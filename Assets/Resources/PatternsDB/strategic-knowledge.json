    "name": "Strategic Knowledge",
    "texts": {
        "definition": "Knowledge based on processing information about the game elements, rules, possible actions, or evaluation functions of a game without regards to a specific game state.",
        "description": [
            "Many games are easier to win if players have information about how the actions and events work, even though it is not necessarily required to be able to play. When this information is usable for all game sessions of the same game, the information is \"Strategic Knowledge\" about the game."
        ],
        "examples": [
            "The locations of power-ups and pick-ups in first-person shooter deathmatches are essential knowledge for players to successfully compete against each other.",
            "The knowledge of long sequences of combos in fighting games such as the \"Tekken\" or \"Dead or Alive\" series are \"Strategic Knowledge\" to players, even if they may not have the skill to successfully perform them."
        ],
        "usage": [
            "Providing players with \"Strategic Knowledge\" about rules are necessary in \"Self-Facilitated Games\" but can be used to create \"Smooth Learning Curves\" in other games. Besides rules, \"Strategic Knowledge\" can be about the configuration of the \"Game World\", the value of different goals, how to perform certain actions, and the likelihood of different actions and events to take place in a game.",
            "Knowledge about the \"Game World\" consists of knowing where \"Strategic Locations\" are, for example \"Shared Resources\" or \"Power-Ups\", and can help \"Game World Navigation\" and winning \"Races\". The knowledge about the correct values of goals consists mainly of knowing the \"Tradeoff\" values between various \"Resources\",\"Rewards\", and \"Penalties\". This can be used to influence choices in \"Selectable Sets of Goals\" and \"Hierarchies of Goals\", and knowing when to strive for \"Transfer of Control\" or what areas to try and achieve \"Area Control\" over. In cases of \"Unknown Goals\", knowing what \"Predefined Goals\" exist is \"Strategic Knowledge\" in itself. Examples of \"Strategic Knowledge\" related to information about actions are how to perform \"Combos\", what \"Achilles' Heels\" enemies have, and what places are most important to \"Guard\". Knowing the likelihood of events and actions mainly consists of knowing all the possible \"Predictable Consequences\" in games or the probabilities of \"Dice\" and other randomizers in games with high degrees of \"Randomness\". The easiest knowledge in these cases are predetermined \"Ultra-Powerful Events\" such as \"Moveable Tiles\" or \"Shrinking Game Worlds\". Knowledge of the exact effects of \"Damage\" or \"Delayed Effects\", and the \"Tradeoffs\" between \"Risk/Reward\" choices (especially in \"Betting\") are also part of these types of \"Strategic Knowledge\".",
            "A typical way of letting players acquire \"Strategic Knowledge\" is through \"Game State Overviews\", \"Cut Scenes\", \"Experimenting\", or being \"Spectators\" to games played by others. This becomes easier when the information presented is \"Perfect Information\" and, in the case of \"Spectators\", requires that the information is \"Public Information\"."
        ],
        "consequences": [
            "\"Strategic Knowledge\" about a game gives players \"Empowerment\", and if it can successfully be applied to actions performed, it can provide an opportunity for \"Game Mastery\". It encourages \"Stimulated Planning\" both during gameplay and before gameplay begins. The possibility to have \"Strategic Knowledge\" about a game allows \"Extra-Game Actions\" specifically for extracting and \"Memorizing\" that knowledge, and communicating the knowledge between players makes it into \"Extra-Game Information\" if done through \"Storytelling\" within the game or \"Trans-Game Information\" if done by other means outside the game. The possibility also gives an incentive for \"Replayability\" in the game to learn and make use of the \"Strategic Knowledge\", for example, in \"Tournaments\".",
            "\"Strategic Knowledge\" affects players' \"Illusion of Influence\" depending on whether players actually have any influence. It typically removes players' ability to feel that they have \"Luck\" in the game but can be used to create knowledge-based \"Meta Games\"."
