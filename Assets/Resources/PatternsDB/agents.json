            "Sometimes one cannot find enough players to make a game playable or enjoyable. To make gameplay possible in these situations, the game design may provide means of simulating players. These simulated players, or [Agents](agents), can also be used to flesh out team-based games so that the teams are of equal size or simply let players train without having to play against other people."

        "examples": [
            "Bots in first-person shooters or real-time strategy games let players simulate multiplayer variants of the game."

        "usage": [
            "Creating [Agents](agents) requires that [Dedicated Game Facilitators](dedicated-game-facilitators) can sufficiently simulate the actions and plans of players, which in many cases requires significant computer power and AI programming. However, the skill of these [Agents](agents) can easily be downgraded once they have been created and this can be used to create [Handicaps](handicaps) for players."
        ],
        "consequences": [
            "[Agents](agents) provide the possibility to play [Multiplayer Games](multiplayer-games) when not enough players are available by providing [Enemies](enemies) controlled by the game system. This allows for [Competition](competition), [Conflict](conflict), and [Tied Results](tied-results), and even [Social Interaction](social-interaction) to be present, or at least simulated, in situations where they would otherwise be impossible."
