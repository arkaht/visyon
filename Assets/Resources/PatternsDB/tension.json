    "name": "Tension",
    "texts": {
        "definition": "The feeling of caring about the outcome of actions or events in a game without having full control over them.",
        "description": [
            "\"Tension\" occurs in games that have uncertain outcomes, when players have emotional investments in which of these outcomes occurs but cannot fully control them. \"Tension\" can be either due to several sorts of interest in the outcome for players: if they are trying to make one of the outcomes occur; if the outcome has an affect of characters in the game that the players care for; or if the outcome has real-world effects."
        ],
        "examples": [
            "Having placed most of one's markers in a bet in \"Poker\" is a classical case where players can feel tension.",
            "The dark and claustrophobic environments in the \"Doom\" games easily cause \"Tension\" as players guide their \"Avatars\" through rooms and corridors, expecting monsters to appear."
        ],
        "usage": [
            "The presence of \"Deadly Traps\", \"Player Killing\",\"Player Elimination\", and \"Enemies\" with \"Overcome\" goals guarantees the existence of forces that are trying to inflict \"Penalties\" or \"Damage\" on players, so these can be used to create \"Tension\". This can be further modulated by using \"Near Miss Indicators\", by making the \"Enemies\" more powerful over time, as \"Boss Monsters\" are examples of, or by making \"Tied Results\" impossible through \"Tiebreakers\". The threat of \"Early Elimination\" is a concrete way to raise \"Tension\". \"Competition\" and \"Conflict\" between players also creates \"Tension\", often more than by the presence of \"Enemies\". This \"Tension\" between the players can be modulated with \"Balancing Effects\". When the ways to overcomethe \"Enemies\" orother players depend on \"Paper-Rock-Scissors\" relations, the \"Tension\" can be further increased since players may choose ineffective methods. \"Consumers\" with no positive effects that automatically consume players' \"Resources\" provide similar \"Tension\" to players as \"Enemies\" and opposing players.",
            "\"Narrative Structures\" can create \"Tension\" in games in the same ways as in other narrative mediums, and can be modulated by \"Clues\" or \"Red Herrings\", but can also do so in games through modulating players' \"Perceived Chance to Succeed\", typically by giving players an \"Uncertainty of Information\". However, when narratives do not contain \"Tension\", or when the unfolding of them causes players to have \"Downtime\", players are likely to lose any feeling of \"Tension\". \"Game Masters\" can notice these occurrences and adjust the \"Narrative Structure\" or interaction accordingly.",
            "Putting \"Time Limits\" on how long players have to try and succeed with actions is an effective way to create \"Tension\". This can be done as an explicit \"Time Limit\" or be achieved implicitly through \"The Show Must Go On\". The \"Tension\" can then be further increased by requiring \"Attention Swapping\".",
            "Another way to modulate the \"Tension\" is by restricting players' powers or freedom, for example, by \"Shrinking Game Worlds\",\"Limited Set of Actions\", or \"Movement Limitations\". The\"Tension\" caused by dangerous opponents or objects in the \"Game World\" can be modulated by setting the \"Right Level of Difficulty\" and can be made to be present before the threats themselves when \"Traces\" are used.",
            "Forcing players to make commitments and then not letting them affect the outcome, or at least limit how they can affect the outcome, can create \"Tension\". \"Betting\" and \"Stealth\" are similar in that they are activities that require \"Turn Taking\", \"Downtime\", and \"No-Ops\" can create \"Tension\", and both are usually combined with \"Randomness\", \"Tradeoffs\", \"Risk/Reward\" choices, and the possibility to feel \"Luck\". \"Geometric Rewards for Investments\" can create this form of \"Tension\" as the invested \"Resources\" are bound, and failed investments cause not only the already invested resources to be lost but lessen the value of \"Resources\" that have not yet been invested. This form of \"Tension\" can be further modulated through the presence of \"Progress Indicators\" and \"Status Indicators\" but can be ruined by \"Perfect Information\" about the evaluation function and all the game state values that affect the function. However, \"Tension\" can be lost instead of created if the players lose a \"Perceived Chance to Succeed\" because of necessary \"Leaps of Faith\", extended \"Downtime\", or \"Turn Taking\".",
            "Many activities and goals in games combine several of these aspects, for example, \"Combat\" or \"Aim &amp; Shoot\" activities give players opponents and threaten to take players' \"Lives\". \"Continuous Goals\" and \"Extended Actions\" with\"Delayed Effects\" can combine the risk of losing ongoing \"Rewards\" with the threats of \"Penalties\", for example, through \"King of the Hill\" or \"Evade\" goals and in \"Quick Games\".",
            "Many aspects of \"Cooperation\" and \"Social Interaction\" where players have to rely on other players' actions give rise to \"Tension\". Any interaction where \"Uncertainty of Information\" or possibility for disinformationexists due to player communication can generate \"Tension,\" but it is especially likely to occur with \"Delayed Reciprocity\" or when \"Betrayal\" and \"Bluffing\" is possible. Examples when \"Tension\" can be created in this fashion include \"Player-Decided Distribution of Rewards &amp; Penalties\" and the presence of \"Shared Resources\". \"Tension\" related to \"Social Interaction\" exists in many cases for both the ones that can lose from the actions and the ones that can gain, as is typical in \"Social Dilemmas\".",
            "\"Reversability\" and the possibility to recreate previous game states through \"Save-Load Cycles\" lessens \"Tension\", as players can replay moments that contained \"Tension\" and the feeling is less likely to be as strong on subsequent exposures. Therefore, \"Tension\" does not usually work together with general \"Experimenting\", although they can do so when the experimentation is motivated by \"Player Defined Goals\"."
        ],
        "consequences": [
            "\"Tension\" is one of the more direct ways game can be designed to have \"Emotional Immersion\". \"Tension\" can be caused by putting players in the position of missing \"Rewards\" or in the position of receiving \"Penalties\", which either affect themselves or something with which they have \"Identification\". Especially \"Competition\" and questions of \"Ownership\" can evoke \"Tension\", in the latter case either because players have \"Gain Ownership\" goals or because opponents want to take away \"Ownership\" of something from players. \"Anticipation\" is a way to modulate \"Tension\", the more \"Anticipation\" players feel, the more \"Tension\" they will also likely feel. Feeling forced to perform actions within a certain \"Time Limit\", for example in \"The Show Must Go On\", can in some cases be a reason for \"Tension\" to occur. \"Game Pauses\" in general have an effect on levels of \"Tension\".",
            "\"Tension\" can spill from games into the real world as \"Extra-Game Consequences\", and the risk for this happening increase with the presence, as especially combinations of, extra-game rewards, \"Social Interaction\", and questions of \"Ownership\".",
            "Repeated exposure to the same form of events or actions decreases the \"Tension\" they cause, so \"Replayability\" and \"Tension\" is difficult to combine, especially if the \"Tension\" is caused by \"Narrative Structures\" or other effects that rely on players not knowing what will occur. This problem of repeated exposure can partly be mitigated by \"Higher-Level Closures as Gameplay Progresses\", as for example, naturally occurs in \"Tournaments\" or can be explicitly designed through \"Boss Monsters\" or \"Narrative Structures\"."
