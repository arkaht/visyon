    "texts": {
        "definition": "Players' chance of succeeding with an action as a function within the game is increased, or the calculated effect the action has increased in the game.",
        "description": [
            "Players can progress in games by having their actions effect on the [Game World](game-world) increase and by having greater chances of succeeding. When these chances or effects have improved, the players have received [Improved Abilities](improved-abilities) and have greater chances of completing goals or otherwise influencing the game state.",
            "[Improved Abilities](improved-abilities) are not the physical or mental abilities of players; they are the effects of the game state upon the evaluation functions of actions."
        ],
        "examples": [
            "Tabletop roleplaying games often describe players' skill in an area with a value, and succeeding with the skill requires players to roll below the value with a die. Improvement of these skills is done simply by increasing the associated value.",
            "Chargers and power-ups in racing games often give vehicles a speed boost or raise the maximum speed possible without further affecting players' possible actions."
        ],
        "usage": [
            "[Improved Abilities](improved-abilities) most often raise players' chance to succeed with actions or make the effects of their actions more powerful. [Improved Abilities](improved-abilities) are often easier to explain within a [Consistent Reality Logic](consistent-reality-logic) than [New Abilities](new-abilities), as the pattern can use increases of [Skills](skills) of [Characters](characters) or [Avatars](avatars). [Power-Ups](power-ups) and [Chargers](chargers) are common game elements used to provide temporary [Improved Abilities](improved-abilities) with [Time Limits](time-limits), while [Tools](tools) give improvements as long as they are carried. Another way to give players [Improved Abilities](improved-abilities) is to make their actions require fewer [Resources](resources), thereby letting players make more efficient use of [Limited Resources](limited-resources).",
            "As a [Balancing Effect](balancing-effects), [Diminishing Returns](diminishing-returns) can be used to avoid letting players with powerful abilities more easily get [Improved Abilities](improved-abilities) than other players. In the same way, [New Abilities](new-abilities) can be balanced by [Ability Losses](ability-losses) in other [Competence Areas](competence-areas); game design can have [Balancing Effects](balancing-effects) by linking [Decreased Abilities](decreased-abilities) in some areas to [Improved Abilities](improved-abilities) in others."
        ],
        "consequences": [
            "[Improved Abilities](improved-abilities) are [Rewards](rewards) that give players [Empowerment](empowerment) and promote [Competence Areas](competence-areas). The improvement is typically a consequence of [Gain Competence](gain-competence) goals or the acquisition of [Tools](tools) as part of [Gain Ownership](gain-ownership) goals. Gaining [Improved Abilities](improved-abilities) creates [Supporting Goals](supporting-goals), as they empower players to influence the game state and thereby can raise players' [Perceived Chance to Succeed](perceived-chanceto-succeed) as well as create [Illusion of Influences](illusionof-influence).",
            "Like [New Abilities](new-abilities), the improvement of abilities is a form of [Character Development](character-development) and when players' are given a [Freedom of Choice](freedomof-choice) to affect what abilities are improved, it gives rise to [Planned Character Development](planned-character-development). In games with [Team Play](team-play), this provides [Team Development](team-development), with the additional effect of [Orthogonal Unit Differentiation](orthogonal-unit-differentiation). [Improved Abilities](improved-abilities) can also, like [New Abilities](new-abilities), give rise to [Red Queen Dilemmas](red-queen-dilemmas) when competing players can have [Improved Abilities](improved-abilities) several times during gameplay.",
            "The difference between [New Abilities](new-abilities) and [Improved Abilities](improved-abilities) is often one of scale or perspective: are the abilities activated in the same fashion as before, do they affect the same parts of the game state, and are does the [Alternative Reality](alternative-reality) explain them as being different or the same?"
