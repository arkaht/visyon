    "name": "Emotional Immersion",
    "texts": {
        "definition": "Being emotionally affected by the events that occur in a game.",
        "description": [
            "Games can raise strong emotions in players. This can be because the stories present in the games, but just as likely because of emotional investments players have in the outcome of the game or characters they have created."
        ],
        "examples": [
            "the appeal of story-driven games such as \"Myst\" lies primarily in the emotional intensity players receive by the unfolding of the story through their actions and the exploration of the game world.",
            "the darkness, loneliness and threat of violence are the primary ingredients in setting the mood in games such as the \"Doom\" series."
        ],
        "usage": [
            "\"Emotional Immersion\" can be created in games both through the possibility of \"Rewards\" and \"Penalties\" and through performed actions. \"Rewards\" typically give short burst of \"Emotional Immersion\" when they are received, besides any \"Anticipation\" players have, while \"Penalties\" also can give short peaks of immersion when they occur but typically give continuous \"Tension\" as long as the possibility for the \"Penalties\" exist. For actions, \"Emotional Immersion\" can be created in games regardless of whether they affect the game state or not.",
            "The use of \"Narrative Structures\" and \"Social Interaction\" are powerful ways of achieving \"Emotional Immersion\", especially through \"Social Dilemmas\" and \"Betrayal\", which can affect the game state directly but does not have to. \"Ownership\" is one of the easiest ways to create \"Emotional Immersion\" through actual game state manipulation besides through \"Anticipation\", \"Surprises\", and \"Tension\". For example, \"Betting\" and \"Gain Ownership\" goals appeal to players' wishes to possess, and \"Transfer of Control\" fulfills these wishes. The loss of \"Resources\", \"Lives\" ï¿½ or \"Area Control\" are all losses of \"Ownership\" in one sense or another and can create the opposing emotional reactions that gaining them can create. \"Player Constructed Worlds\", \"Player Defined Goals\", \"Characters\", and\"Creative Control\" can not only let players have a feeling of \"Ownership\" in the game but \"Ownership\" of something they themselves have created, often by \"Extra-Game Actions\" as simple as choosing their own \"Handles\". This sense of \"Ownership\" is further heightened with \"Persistent Game Worlds\". Although important in many cases of \"Emotional Immersion\", having a \"Perceived Chance to Succeed\" and \"Illusion of Influence\" is especially important when \"Ownership\" is concerned. \"Storytelling\" and \"Roleplaying\" are examples of how \"Emotional Immersion\" can be promoted by combining \"Narrative Structures\", \"Social Interaction\" and \"Creative Control\" in actions performed by \"Game Masters\" or players for the other players.",
            "The use of \"Avatars\" that players control may actually hinder \"Emotional Immersion\" when player can see the \"Characters\" that they are controlling; if the appearance or actions of an \"Avatar\" does not follow the players' expectations they can easily feel distanced from the \"Character\" also, and thereby lose \"Emotional Immersion\". However, distancing the player from a \"Game World\" through for example \"God Views\" is even more likely to cause the \"Emotional Immersion\" to be lost.",
            "Providing players with explicit information about the game state through \"Direct Information\" can easily disrupt \"Emotional Immersion\" as the player is reminded that the game is a model. \"Indirect Information\" can avoid this but must be used so that the style of the presentation follows the \"Consistent Reality Logic\" of the \"Game World\"."

        "consequences": [
            "\"Emotional Immersion\" is one form of \"Immersion\" in games and affects how players struggle towards goals, how they make \"Risk/Reward\" choices, and their motivations for playing a game. It requires \"Identification\" with some part in the game to exist and is both a cause for \"Anticipation\" and an effect of it. \"Game Mastery\" in a game can give \"Emotional Immersion\" in a game due to the \"Empowerment\" mastery gives, but this type of \"Emotional Immersion\" is broken if the players \"Perceived Chance to Succeed\" or \"Illusion of Influence\" is removed. \"Freedom of Choice\" has the same form of relations to \"Emotional Immersion\" as \"Game Mastery\". Games can provide many of the emotional responses that other medium with \"Narrative Structures\" can, but emotional responses can also be achieved through the actions players take. Among those easy to create by interaction in games are \"Anticipation\", \"Surprises\", \"Tension\", Stress, Horror, Disgust, Frustration, and Wonder. Examples of how these can be achieved are through the use of \"Conflict\", \"Exploration\", \"Hovering Closures,\" or \"Overcome\" goals.",
            "\"Emotional Immersion\" can easily be lost if the \"Consistent Reality Logic\" of the \"Alternative Reality\" is broken. \"Attention Swapping\", which can be used to modulate \"Narrative Structure\" with great efficiency in other mediums, forces players to either move between \"Focus Loci\" or loss them altogether and can thereby negatively affect \"Emotional Immersion\" in games.",
            "\"Emotional Immersion\" can easily disrupt \"Cognitive Immersion\" in a game and can be difficult to achieve when one already has \"Cognitive Immersion\"."
