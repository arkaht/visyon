        "description": [
            "Many games let players control game elements that represent people or creatures that act in the [Game World](game-world). When these people or creatures have characteristics not directly shown in the [Game World](game-world) that can change during gameplay, these game elements have an abstract element called [Character](characters)."
        ],
        "examples": [
            "Roleplaying games let each player control a character, and one of the main types of achievement in the games is to raise the character's level, stats, or skills.",
            "\"Return to Castle Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory\" is a first-person shooter where players have characters that can develop between levels by gaining experience points in various skills."

        "usage": [
            "The design of use of [Characters](characters) in games can either be on the level of creating explicit characters or by creating rules for how players can create their own [Characters](characters). Independent of how [Characters](characters) are created, the game designer can choose whether [Character Development](character-development) should be possible and if players should be able to affect it. Allowing players control over [Character Development](character-development) increases [Freedom of Choice](freedomof-choice) as well as creates [Planned Character Development](planned-character-development), which is a form of [Investment](investments). This planning offers players the chance of [Varied Gameplay](varied-gameplay) by making use of [New Abilities](new-abilities) to instantiate potential [Orthogonal Unit Differentiation](orthogonal-unit-differentiation). [Planned Character Development](planned-character-development) gives the possibility for [Team Development](team-development) in games with [Team Play](team-play). However, unless games make use of [Game Masters](game-masters), this kind of [Freedom of Choice](freedomof-choice) regarding [Characters](characters) may be difficult to combine with [Narrative Structures](narrative-structures).",
            "Creating complete [Characters](characters) lets them fit within an [Alternative Reality](alternative-reality) and allows personalized and unique [Avatars](avatars) for each [Character](characters). In games with [Combat](combat) or [Overcome](overcome) goals between the players, pre-created [Characters](characters) can be extensively play-tested to ensure [Player Balance](player-balance). The use of pre-created [Characters](characters) is common in games either where [Character Development](character-development) is not a large part of gameplay or where the [Character](characters), and any [Character Development](character-development), is closely tied to a tightly controlled [Narrative Structure](narrative-structures).",
            "Typical ways of letting players create [Characters](characters) are based around [Randomness](randomness) or [Budgeted Action Points](budgeted-action-points). These are in turn used to determine the many various characteristics possible: the [Handle](handles) that identifies the character to other players; number values that represent physical or mental abilities or status of measurements such as [Lives](lives), health, and fatigue; [Skills](skills) that affect the likelihood of succeeding with actions and may give [Privileged Abilities](privileged-abilities) such as being a [Producer](producers) that can create [Renewable Resources](renewable-resources); advantages, disadvantages, quirks, or other ways of describing character traits and motivating initial \"Decreased Abilities, Improved Abilities\", or [Privileged Abilities](privileged-abilities); worldly possessions and equipment that represents [Resources](resources) or [Tools](tools); and occupations, social statuses, and social networks that define the characters place in the [Game World](game-world). In games with [Avatars](avatars), some of these characteristics are usually cosmetic. The variety of values associated with [Characters](characters) then open up for the range of [Rewards](rewards), such as [Improved Abilities](improved-abilities) through raised [Skills](skills), and [Penalties](penalties), such as [Decreased Abilities](decreased-abilities) through received [Damage](damage), that can occur during gameplay.",
            "When players have rules for creating [Characters](characters), this gives them [Freedom of Choice](freedomof-choice) and [Creative Control](creative-control) depending on the level of [Randomness](randomness) involved in the process, but this increases the possibilities for [Identification](identification) and[Immersion](immersion) through [Emotional Immersion](emotional-immersion) in all cases. The personalization possible also allows players to construct [Player Defined Goals](player-defined-goals) for their [Characters](characters) as they are created, and can give them the [Illusion of Influence](illusionof-influence) over how the [Narrative Structure](narrative-structures) will develop. However, with a larger amount of [Freedom of Choice](freedomof-choice) regarding the character creation process, the problem of fitting or adjusting the character to an integral role in a [Narrative Structure](narrative-structures) increases also. This problem can be mitigated by the presence of [Dedicated Game Facilitators](dedicated-game-facilitators) that can perform [Negotiation](negotiation) to make the [Character](characters) suitable to the planned events in the game or modify the [Narrative Structure](narrative-structures) to fit the [Character](characters)."
        ],
        "consequences": [
            "[Characters](characters) provide games with points for [Identification](identification) and through these points [Emotional Immersion](emotional-immersion), which can strengthen the impact of, and widen the range of, [Penalties](penalties) usable in the game, especially in the case of [Persistent Game Worlds](persistent-game-worlds). The presence of [Characters](characters) also allows more detailed [Enemies](enemies) and richer [Narrative Structure](narrative-structures) where social relationships and [Character Development](character-development) can be important components. This is especially true in cases where [Roleplaying](roleplaying) the [Characters](characters) or [Storytelling](storytelling) about the [Characters](characters) is possible.",
            "In games with [Game Worlds](game-world), [Characters](characters) form links between abstract game state values and concrete game state values through their connection to [Avatars](avatars). When no concrete [Game World](game-world) exists, [Characters](characters) take the role of [Focus Loci](focus-loci) in replacement of [Avatars](avatars).",
            "In [Multiplayer Games](multiplayer-games), having [Characters](characters) with different [Privileged Abilities](privileged-abilities) allows [Orthogonal Unit Differentiation](orthogonal-unit-differentiation) and lets players specialize in different [Competence Areas](competence-areas). However, the differences in abilities may cause [Player Balance](player-balance) to be disrupted."
