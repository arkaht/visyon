        "examples": [
            "in the early first-person computer roleplaying game \"Dungeon Master\" the buttons and levers on the walls are used to open doors, walls, and sections of the floor."
        ],
        "usage": [
            "[Buttons](buttons) can be sticky, i. e. they stay pressed allowing the players to know if the [Button](buttons) is activated or not. If the [Button](buttons) can be pressed again to inactivate it, this can be used to create [Reversability](reversability), while those that cannot be changed back enforce [Irreversible Actions](irreversible-actions). Buttons, which are not sticky, can cycle through a series of states, for example, pressing a button repeatedly can let a player decide which of the three doors are open."

        "consequences": [
            "[Buttons](buttons) are simple [Controllers](controllers) that allow for a limited range of actions. Their use is trivial to understand, although the effect of activating a [Button](buttons) may be complex and have long-term consequences."
