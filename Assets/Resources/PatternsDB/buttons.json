        "examples": [
            "in the early first-person computer roleplaying game \"Dungeon Master\" the buttons and levers on the walls are used to open doors, walls, and sections of the floor."
        ],
        "usage": [
            "\"Buttons\" can be sticky, i. e. they stay pressed allowing the players to know if the \"Button\" is activated or not. If the \"Button\" can be pressed again to inactivate it, this can be used to create \"Reversability\", while those that cannot be changed back enforce \"Irreversible Actions\". Buttons, which are not sticky, can cycle through a series of states, for example, pressing a button repeatedly can let a player decide which of the three doors are open."

            "\"Buttons\" are simple \"Controllers\" that allow for a limited range of actions. Their use is trivial to understand, although the effect of activating a \"Button\" may be complex and have long-term consequences."
