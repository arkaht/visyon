        "description": [
            "Some games do not associate the user's focus of attention in a game with any particular game element. In these games the view the user has of the game is likewise independent of game elements, similar to the omniscience of a [God Views](god-views)."
        ],
        "examples": [
            "\"SimCity\" allows players to move around the city without having to consider the locations of any individual game element such as cars or pedestrians.",
            "\"Populous\", as an example of a god game unsurprisingly provides players with [God Views.](god-views)"
        ],
        "usage": [
            "Similar to [Third-Person Views,](third-person-views) games with [God Views](god-views) that require [Imperfect Information](imperfect-information) about the terrain in the [Game World](game-world) must either use [Fog of War](fogof-war) or divide the game area into sections. The use of [God Views](god-views) does not have to be omnipotent; the view of a [Game World](game-world) can easily be restricted by restricting the movement and direction of the [Camera](cameras) use to provide the [God View](god-views)."
        ],
        "consequences": [
            "[God Views](god-views) provide [Game State Overviews](game-state-overview) which can easily and quickly be moved, making them ideal for [Attention Swapping](attention-swapping) but hinder [Spatial Immersion](spatial-immersion) and make [Aim & Shoot](aim-shoot) actions difficult. They do not easily work with [Avatars](avatars) as the link between player attention and the [Avatar](avatars) is weak, and thereby the possibilities of [Emotional Immersion](emotional-immersion) are low. Sometimes [Public Information](public-information) uses [God Views](god-views) to provide the [Spectators](spectators) with more information than is given to the players."
