        "definition": "The feeling that random effects are not random but favorable to the player.",
        "description": [
            "Many events in games are impossible for players to control in a predictable and repeatable fashion. However, when players feel that they can affect this event anyway, either through how they perform the action or what they wish for when the effect of the action is being determined, they may feel that they have \"Luck\"."
        ],
        "examples": [
            "Letting players roll dice in any game is motivated primarily by letting players experience the possibility of \"Luck\"; the main other reason is that nobody else should have to perform the physical actions for the players' game action.",
            "The high level of \"Luck\" in gambling games lets most people start playing the games easily and feel that they are competent players, even though \"Game Mastery\" might be very difficult to achieve."
        ],
        "usage": [
            "\"Luck\" is hard to explicitly design players to experience unless the game system cheats. This can be instantiated by \"Game Masters\" to provide maximum \"Tension\" but is a \"Risk/Reward\" choice, because if players notice the cheating, they will lose all \"Illusion of Influence\".",
            "Designing for the possibility for players to feel lucky is much easier, most often simply some form of \"Randomness\" is sufficient. Typical ways of letting players feel \"Luck\" are through letting them roll \"Dice\", giving them hidden \"Card Hands\", or letting \"Near Miss Indicators\" show them how close they were to being affected by dangers. For \"Betting\", actions based around \"Skills\", or \"Overcome\" goals that are determined by \"Randomness\", players may base their \"Risk/Reward\" choices upon how much \"Luck\" they feel that they have.",
            "Parts of \"Polyathlons\" that appear to depend on \"Luck\" add elements not depending on player skills and that may have less \"Predictable Consequences\"."
        ],
        "consequences": [
            "\"Luck\" gives players an \"Illusion of Influence\" in games and can create \"Tension\" when perceived in actions that have \"Delayed Effects\". Games, which rely heavily on \"Randomness\", or at least lack \"Predictable Consequences\", often make it possible for players to feel that the outcome depends on \"Luck\", and thereby give these games deceptive \"Smooth Learning Curves\". Games depending totally on \"Randomness\" can be said to depend solely on \"Luck\" and have no \"Game Mastery\", but many games with high levels of \"Randomness\" can have \"Game Mastery\" through \"Bluffing\" or \"Strategic Knowledge\" about probabilities, although \"Meta Games\" and \"Tournaments\" or other forms of playing many game sessions may be required to notice the \"Game Mastery\"."
