        "description": [
            "\"Rewards\" are the positive effects that players hope to get by completing goals. The \"Rewards\" may be changes to the game state or other game related effects that make other goals easier to complete, or may be effects outside the game."
        ],
        "examples": [
            "Managing to pick a box in \"Mario Kart Double Dash!!\" or \"Monkey Race 2\" in \"Super Monkey Ball 2\" give the players the reward of a special power they can active later.",
            "\"Betting\" in games is a common form of providing \"Rewards\" outside the game due to what happens in the game. \"Betting\" can be added to all games to add this form of \"Reward\", but some games such as playing on horses consist only of choosing what to bet on.",
            "All games that can be won have the main reward of winning the game."
        ],
        "usage": [
            "\"Rewards\" are one of the main ways game designers have to encourage players to do certain actions in a game. However, the players must be aware of the \"Rewards\" for the \"Rewards\" to be able to influence them, and players must feel that the \"Reward\" is purposeful either to advance their chances in the game or give enjoyable \"Extra-Game Consequences\". For example, it makes little sense to let players know what a \"Reward\" is for an \"Unknown Goal\", or have \"Rewards\" that only support the completion of \"Excluding Goals\".",
            "\"Mutual Goals\" allow for a number of additional design opportunities for \"Rewards\", as these goals support \"Individual Rewards\", \"Shared Rewards\", and \"Player-Decided Distribution of Rewards &amp; Penalties\". The first option can promote \"Conflict\" or lessen predictabilitydepending on whether the choice of who receives the \"Reward\" is based upon who completes the goal or \"Randomness\". The second option supports \"Team Play\" and can support \"Investment\" if the proportion of the \"Reward\" depends upon some quantifiable measure of effort to reach the goal. Examples of different design approaches for how \"Investments\" should affect \"Rewards\" are \"Geometric Rewards for Investments\", \"Arithmetic Rewards for Investments\", and \"Diminishing Returns\". \"Player-Decided Distribution of Rewards &amp; Penalties\" can require \"Negotiation\" and have \"Balancing Effects\", since the player controlling the distribution can make choices depending on the current situation in the game at the time when the \"Reward\" is distributed. In all cases, the motivation for trying to get \"Rewards\" candepend upon how much \"Identification\" players have with what is trying to get the \"Reward\" in the game.",
            "\"Rewards\" are an easy way to create \"Tension\" and \"Competition\" between players. A typical example of this is the \"Competition\" in \"Bidding\" and \"Trading\" where the possible \"Rewards\" direct much of the struggle or the \"Tension\" in games where \"Player Killing\" is possible and can be seen as a \"Reward\" for the players doing the action. More abstract, collections of \"Rewards\" can be designed to put players in positions where they have \"Red Queen Dilemmas\" and must strive to improve simply to maintain their relative position compared to other players. \"Rewards\" can also be designed so that they give rise to \"Social Dilemmas\", for example when \"Betrayal\" is possible.",
            "\"Rewards\" can be divided into rewards that affect gameplay and those that are \"Extra-Game Consequences\", typically winning the game or winning a bet based on the game. Common in-game rewards are \"Improved Abilities\" and \"New Abilities\", the latter of which have greater value if they also are \"Privileged Abilities\" such as gaining access to new \"Combos\". By tying these effects to \"Characters\", for example through \"Skills\", the \"Rewards\" can become permanent and create \"Character Development\", which can drive \"Narrative Structures\". By tying them to \"Tools\", players can instead have \"Ownership\" but may risk losing the \"Rewards\". Examples of \"Extra-Game Consequences\" are \"Illusionary Rewards\" andsocial rewards. These are the usual results of \"Player Defined Goals\", but \"Illusionary Rewards\" can be designed as formal results of completing goals to provide \"Extra-Game Information\". Both \"Extra-Game Consequences\" and in-game \"Rewards\" can give \"Social Status\", although in the second case it is usually tied to \"Privileged Abilities\".",
            "\"Rewards\" may allow players to decide the exact configuration of the \"Reward\" to support \"Freedom of Choice.\" How this affects gameplay depends primarily on when players can affect the configuration: before starting the goal, during the completion of the goal, or after the goal is completed.",
            "The possibility of configuring \"Rewards\" tied to goals before trying to complete the goals is only meaningful if these goals are \"Committed Goals\". The commitments may be as simple as not being able to change the configuration later or may be tied to \"Penalties\", but the commitments do represent \"Risk/Reward\" choices as players cannot change them later. This causes \"Stimulated Planning\" but requires that players have a \"Game State Overview\" and that the game supports predictability. Otherwise, the commitment is simply one to \"Luck\", as would be the case with \"Betting\" (in contrast to the fixed ante) in \"Poker\" before looking at any cards.",
            "Being able to affect \"Rewards\" while trying to reach them is usually done through \"Investments\", where the \"Investment\" represents the commitment and well as part of the \"Penalty\" if it is lost if the goal is failed. \"Betting\" is a typical example of such an \"Investment\" where the \"Reward\" is in direct proportion to the \"Investment\". The function between the \"Investments\" and the \"Rewards\" can be used to modulate player interest in \"Investment\":\"Geometric Rewards for Investments\" encourage specialization, increases the \"Risk/Reward\" of the \"Investment\", and may disrupt \"Player Balance\"; \"Arithmetic Rewards for Investments\" have the most \"Predictable Consequences\" but may negatively affect \"Perceived Chance to Succeed\"; while \"Diminishing Returns\" encourage diversification between different goals if possible and may have \"Balancing Effects\".",
            "\"Freedom of Choice\" to personalized \"Rewards\" affecting \"Character\" is common in roleplaying games and supports \"Planned Character Development\". In games with \"Conflict\", choosing what \"Resource\" to replenish or what \"New Ability\" to receive can have \"Balancing Effects\". Giving \"Penalties\" to other players is another form of player controlled \"Reward\" that can be used in games with \"Conflict\".",
            "Another way of making it possible to affect how \"Rewards\" are distributed after a goal has been achieved is to embed the \"Reward\" in a game element. For example, gaining \"Area Control\" may give \"Resources\" or \"New Abilities\" but it is impossible or at least difficult to steal the actual area. If instead the \"Rewards\" are given through \"Resources\", \"Pick-Ups\", or \"Tools\", these resources may be moved, given away, or be stolen by \"Enemies\". However in both cases, change of \"Ownership\" can change which player has the \"Rewards.\""
        ],
        "consequences": [
            "The presence of \"Rewards\" in games makes goals desirable, and the value of the \"Rewards\" raises the \"Anticipation\" and \"Tension\" for players trying to complete the goals and usually provide short moments of \"Emotional Immersion\" when they are received. Knowing the long-term value, rather than the immediate value, of \"Rewards\" is \"Strategic Knowledge\" for a game and is often required for \"Game Mastery\". \"Rewards\" advance gameplay by offering new goals or making existing goals easier to complete, for example, by giving players \"Improved Abilities\" or \"New Abilities\". For this reason, they often introduce new concepts to the game, requiring the expansion of the \"Alternative Reality\" to maintain the \"Consistent Reality Logic\". \"Rewards\" that allow players to choose the exact effects on the game state from a couple of opinions promote \"Freedom of Choice\". When these choices affect players' \"Characters\", this allows for \"Planned Character Development\".",
            "What type of goals the \"Rewards\" are linked to affects the value of the \"Reward\". The \"Rewards\" of \"Player Defined Goals\" are, unless the game allows formalization of such goals, social rewardsor \"Illusionary Rewards\", without impact on the game state. \"Rewards\" for \"Unknown Goals\" are \"Surprises\" but once received, the knowledge of the existence of such goals and their rewards is \"Strategic Knowledge.\" Goals and actions linked \"Player-Decided Distribution of Rewards &amp; Penalties\" create \"Risk/Reward\" situations as effort put into reaching the goal may not be rewarded but may also create \"Balancing Effects\".",
            "A \"Penalty\" can modulate a \"Reward\" and vice versato affect the overall value and \"Risk/Reward\" of a goal. This can make a goal less attractive by combining the \"Reward\" for completing the goal with a \"Penalty\" affecting another aspect of the game state. Likewise, the \"Penalty\" for failing to fulfill a goal can be partly mitigated by having an effect similar to a \"Reward\". \"Continuous Goals\" provide a special relationship between \"Penalties\" and \"Rewards\": the \"Penalties\" occur as soon the requirement for the goal fails, while \"Rewards\" either do not exist or are only given after the requirement has been kept until a certain amount of time has passed or another event in the game has occurred.",
            "The actions of receiving \"Rewards\" can be seen as a form of \"Collecting\", especially when the \"Rewards\" are from goals that are part of \"Hierarchies of Goals\". This can be strengthened by using \"Outcome Indicators\" that show statistics of the currently collected \"Rewards\"."
