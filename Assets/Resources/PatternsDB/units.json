    "texts": {
        "definition": "Units are groups of game elements under the player's control that let the player perform actions to influence the Game World.",
        "description": [
            "The \"Units\" can have different actions and attributes associated with them. As a single player controls several \"Units\", the loss of a single \"Unit\" may not determine the final outcome of a game."
        ],
        "examples": [
            "Real-time strategy games make heavy use of \"Units\", where the choice and use of the different available types of units is one of the strategic skills of the games.",
            "\"Pik-Min\", a more or less real-time puzzle game, and \"Lemmings\" are examples of games that make heavy use of \"Units\", which in these cases are only partly under the player's direct control",
            "All the pieces in \"Chess\" except the king are \"Units\".",
            "In the board game \"Space Hulk\", one of the players controls an essentially unlimited amount of \"Units\", called genestealers, which are replenished endlessly. The opposing player has a preset number of \"Units\", called space marines, which are not replenished once lost."
        ],
        "usage": [
            "Several design choices have to be made when using \"Units\". The amount of \"Units\" available to the players is one of the most fundamental choices. The number of the \"Units\" may be preset so that the players have\"Limited Resources\" or it may be determined by \"Randomness\", or depending on the player actions, during the set-up phase. When the players can affect the number of \"Units\" they may have during the gameplay, these \"Units\" are \"Renewable Resources\" and can be rewards for completing subgoals or be produced from \"Resource Generators\" or \"Converters\" that are under the player's control. The \"Units\" themselves may be part of a neutral pool of \"Resources\", which the player can take control over. In most cases, the lifetime of \"Units\" is governed by a \"Producer-Consumer\" pattern. For example in \"Civilization\", the production of \"Units\" is done in cities, and the \"Units\" can be consumed in battle. Control of the \"Producers\" may allow players to gain \"New Abilities\" for their \"Units\", as may \"Transfer of Control\" and \"Ownership\" of enemy \"Units\".",
            "Beyond how many \"Units\" are available to players is the decision of when the players can start to use them. Making all possible \"Units\" available at the start makes them a \"Non-Renewable Resource\" and typically speeds up the game if they can be eliminated during gameplay. Portioning the available \"Units\" over time or giving them out as rewards for goals can be used to maintain the \"Right Level of Complexity\" and avoid \"Analysis Paralysis\".",
            "The abilities of the \"Units\" can either be identical---in order to stress the use of them as a group---or \"Asymmetric Abilities\" offering \"Orthogonal Unit Differentiation\" can be used to provide different \"Privileged Abilities\" for different \"Units\". In the latter case, this can increase the value of each \"Unit\" as it may not be replaced by another and may promote \"Stimulated Planning\" on when and where to use uncommon \"Units\". \"Orthogonal Unit Differentiation\" between \"Units\" under the control of different players may set up \"Paper-Rock-Scissors\" power relations. If the players can control the production of \"Units\", the existence of several different types can promote \"Varied Gameplay\" and \"Tradeoffs\", as the players have to decide what types of \"Units\" they want to acquire.",
            "Naturally, game elements that are \"Units\" cannot also be \"Avatars\". However, \"Units\" can be used as companions to the \"Avatars\"; in this case, they can be given various degrees of autonomy or be directly controlled by the \"Avatar\".",
            "Providing players with sufficient information about the current state of the\"Units\" can require the use of a \"Game State Overview\" or a \"Game World\" that they can view in its entirety. Many games using \"Units\", and especially those where the number of the \"Units\" can change over time, make use of a \"Camera\" for \"Third-Person View\" and a \"God's Finger\" to allow the players to navigate the \"Game World\" in order to locate and select which \"Units\" to use."
        ],
        "consequences": [
            "\"Units\" are a form of \"Resource\" in games, and often acquiring them represents a form of \"Investment\". \"Units\" allow the players to have multiple\"Focus Loci\" where they can affect the \"Game World\" without affecting \"Consistent Reality Logic\". However, this may make it difficult to attain the \"Right Level of Complexity\" due to \"Attention Swapping\". This is especially likely if the game does not support a \"Game State Overview\", which shows relevant information about each player's \"Units\". \"Units\" are often targets of the \"Damages\" from \"Deadly Traps\" and \"Combat\" motivated by other players' \"Eliminate\" goals, resulting either in the destruction of the \"Units\" or in \"Decreased Abilities\" of those \"Units\". The \"Penalties\" of losing the \"Units\" are often \"Ability Losses\", and the player controlling the \"Units\" may have \"Evade\" and \"Survive\" goals.",
            "Various \"Units\" can have different \"Limited Set of Actions\" by making use of \"Orthogonal Unit Differentiation\", so using them can require the players to make \"Tradeoffs\" between different types of \"Units\". Performing the \"Attention Swapping\" between \"Units\" is most commonly enabled by another \"Focus Loci\", a \"God's Finger\". Different stages of the gameplay can further require different types of \"Units\", allowing \"Varied Gameplay\". The different abilities of the \"Units\" do not have to be inherent; the use of \"Tools\" can explain various \"Privileged Abilities\".",
            "\"Units\" let the players simulate \"Team Play\" so they can set up complex actions as well as \"Extended Actions\" by coordinating the individual actions of several \"Units\". This allows \"Stimulated Planning\" and allows the players to do \"Resource Management\" on a higher level than using \"Avatars\", as the destruction or death of the \"Units\" may in some cases even be advantageous and necessary. Thus \"Units\" can be seen as a use of \"Parallel Lives\" which in contrast to \"Avatars\" are more or less dispensable."
