        "definition": "Units are groups of game elements under the player's control that let the player perform actions to influence the Game World.",
        "description": [
            "The [Units](units) can have different actions and attributes associated with them. As a single player controls several [Units](units), the loss of a single [Unit](units) may not determine the final outcome of a game."
        ],
        "examples": [
            "Real-time strategy games make heavy use of [Units](units), where the choice and use of the different available types of units is one of the strategic skills of the games.",
            "\"Pik-Min\", a more or less real-time puzzle game, and \"Lemmings\" are examples of games that make heavy use of [Units](units), which in these cases are only partly under the player's direct control",
            "All the pieces in \"Chess\" except the king are [Units](units).",
            "In the board game \"Space Hulk\", one of the players controls an essentially unlimited amount of [Units](units), called genestealers, which are replenished endlessly. The opposing player has a preset number of [Units](units), called space marines, which are not replenished once lost."
        ],
        "usage": [
            "Several design choices have to be made when using [Units](units). The amount of [Units](units) available to the players is one of the most fundamental choices. The number of the [Units](units) may be preset so that the players have[Limited Resources](limited-resources) or it may be determined by [Randomness](randomness), or depending on the player actions, during the set-up phase. When the players can affect the number of [Units](units) they may have during the gameplay, these [Units](units) are [Renewable Resources](renewable-resources) and can be rewards for completing subgoals or be produced from [Resource Generators](resource-generators) or [Converters](converters) that are under the player's control. The [Units](units) themselves may be part of a neutral pool of [Resources](resources), which the player can take control over. In most cases, the lifetime of [Units](units) is governed by a [Producer-Consumer](producer-consumer) pattern. For example in \"Civilization\", the production of [Units](units) is done in cities, and the [Units](units) can be consumed in battle. Control of the [Producers](producers) may allow players to gain [New Abilities](new-abilities) for their [Units](units), as may [Transfer of Control](transferof-control) and [Ownership](ownership) of enemy [Units](units).",
            "Beyond how many [Units](units) are available to players is the decision of when the players can start to use them. Making all possible [Units](units) available at the start makes them a [Non-Renewable Resource](non-renewable-resources) and typically speeds up the game if they can be eliminated during gameplay. Portioning the available [Units](units) over time or giving them out as rewards for goals can be used to maintain the [Right Level of Complexity](right-levelof-complexity) and avoid [Analysis Paralysis](analysis-paralysis).",
            "The abilities of the [Units](units) can either be identical---in order to stress the use of them as a group---or [Asymmetric Abilities](asymmetric-abilities) offering [Orthogonal Unit Differentiation](orthogonal-unit-differentiation) can be used to provide different [Privileged Abilities](privileged-abilities) for different [Units](units). In the latter case, this can increase the value of each [Unit](units) as it may not be replaced by another and may promote [Stimulated Planning](stimulated-planning) on when and where to use uncommon [Units](units). [Orthogonal Unit Differentiation](orthogonal-unit-differentiation) between [Units](units) under the control of different players may set up [Paper-Rock-Scissors](paper-rock-scissors) power relations. If the players can control the production of [Units](units), the existence of several different types can promote [Varied Gameplay](varied-gameplay) and [Tradeoffs](tradeoffs), as the players have to decide what types of [Units](units) they want to acquire.",
            "Naturally, game elements that are [Units](units) cannot also be [Avatars](avatars). However, [Units](units) can be used as companions to the [Avatars](avatars); in this case, they can be given various degrees of autonomy or be directly controlled by the [Avatar](avatars).",
            "Providing players with sufficient information about the current state of the[Units](units) can require the use of a [Game State Overview](game-state-overview) or a [Game World](game-world) that they can view in its entirety. Many games using [Units](units), and especially those where the number of the [Units](units) can change over time, make use of a [Camera](cameras) for [Third-Person View](third-person-views) and a [God's Finger](god-finger) to allow the players to navigate the [Game World](game-world) in order to locate and select which [Units](units) to use."
        ],
        "consequences": [
            "[Units](units) are a form of [Resource](resources) in games, and often acquiring them represents a form of [Investment](investments). [Units](units) allow the players to have multiple[Focus Loci](focus-loci) where they can affect the [Game World](game-world) without affecting [Consistent Reality Logic](consistent-reality-logic). However, this may make it difficult to attain the [Right Level of Complexity](right-levelof-complexity) due to [Attention Swapping](attention-swapping). This is especially likely if the game does not support a [Game State Overview](game-state-overview), which shows relevant information about each player's [Units](units). [Units](units) are often targets of the [Damages](damage) from [Deadly Traps](deadly-traps) and [Combat](combat) motivated by other players' [Eliminate](eliminate) goals, resulting either in the destruction of the [Units](units) or in [Decreased Abilities](decreased-abilities) of those [Units](units). The [Penalties](penalties) of losing the [Units](units) are often [Ability Losses](ability-losses), and the player controlling the [Units](units) may have [Evade](evade) and [Survive](survive) goals.",
            "Various [Units](units) can have different [Limited Set of Actions](limited-setof-actions) by making use of [Orthogonal Unit Differentiation](orthogonal-unit-differentiation), so using them can require the players to make [Tradeoffs](tradeoffs) between different types of [Units](units). Performing the [Attention Swapping](attention-swapping) between [Units](units) is most commonly enabled by another [Focus Loci](focus-loci), a [God's Finger](god-finger). Different stages of the gameplay can further require different types of [Units](units), allowing [Varied Gameplay](varied-gameplay). The different abilities of the [Units](units) do not have to be inherent; the use of [Tools](tools) can explain various [Privileged Abilities](privileged-abilities).",
            "[Units](units) let the players simulate [Team Play](team-play) so they can set up complex actions as well as [Extended Actions](extended-actions) by coordinating the individual actions of several [Units](units). This allows [Stimulated Planning](stimulated-planning) and allows the players to do [Resource Management](resource-management) on a higher level than using [Avatars](avatars), as the destruction or death of the [Units](units) may in some cases even be advantageous and necessary. Thus [Units](units) can be seen as a use of [Parallel Lives](parallel-lives) which in contrast to [Avatars](avatars) are more or less dispensable."
