        "definition": "Chargers are locations in the Game World that affect the players' resources when they are in the location.",
        "description": [],
        "examples": [
            "Speed boosters in \"Super Monkey Ball II: Monkey Race\" give, as their names imply, more speed to the player driving on top of the charger.",
            "\"Battlefield 1942\" and \"Battlefield Vietnam\" have two categories of chargers: medicine cabinets and ammunition caches that replenish the health and ammunition of the players' \"Avatars\" and repair facilities that fix damages to vehicles.",
            "The board game \"Robo-Rally\" contains repair areas, which remove damage from the player's robot if it spends time there."
        ],
        "usage": [
            "Selecting the \"Improved Abilities\", the \"New Abilities\", and possibly \"Privileged Abilities\", or \"Resource\" gained defines the use of the \"Charger\". The way it produces \"Resources\" is similar to \"Resource Generators\" except that players usually do not have any choice if they should be affected by the \"Charger\" (besides not entering its affect area), and any \"Privileged Ability\" granted by the \"Charger\" may be activated at once, for example, as in the case of speed boosters in most racing games. \"Improved Abilities\" can be handled by simply increasing \"Skills\" or increasing the effect of player actions."
        ],
        "consequences": [
            "\"Chargers\" provide means for players to get \"New Abilities\" or \"Improved Abilities\" as well as providing \"Renewable Resources\".",
            "They function as both \"Resource Locations\" and \"Resource Generators\" but do not produce any \"Resources\" unless a player is within the area, which may require \"Maneuvering\" to get to. They are typically used to give the player \"Renewable Resources\", which can be used as goals or to set the \"Right Level of Complexity\". Their presence in a \"Game World\" creates natural \"Gain Competence\" and \"Traverse\" goals.",
            "If the \"Charger\" provides a bonus beyond the normal limits, i. e., letting players move faster than otherwise possible, it can be seen as a form of \"Power-Up\" that gives \"Privileged Abilities\". For \"Chargers\" that give a certain effect per time unit spent in its effect area, staying on it is a \"Risk/Reward\" \"Tradeoff\" for players as their \"Freedom of Choice\" is limited. If the area that contains the \"Charger\" can be controlled so other players cannot access the \"Charger\", this can give rise to \"Gain Ownership\" goals."
