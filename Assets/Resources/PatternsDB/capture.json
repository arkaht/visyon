    "texts": {
        "definition": "Capture is the goal pattern where the end result is the elimination or change of ownership of an actively resisting goal object.",
        "description": [
            "The [Capture](capture) is done directly by the actions performed by game elements under a player's control; thus, shooting an opponent in a first-person shooter is not an example of [Capture](capture)."
        ],
        "examples": [
            "\"Go\" allows [Capture](capture) by completely enclosing an enemy group of stones.",
            "\"Qix\" allows the player to catch computer-controlled units by enclosing them in the smaller area of the two areas that are created by outlining a path in the unmarked part of the game area.",
            "Priests in \"Age of Empires\" can convert pieces controlled by other players as their main offensive action."
        ],
        "usage": [
            "The prime design choice regarding [Capture](capture) is to decide if the aim is to [Eliminate](eliminate) or [Gain Ownership](gain-ownership), but can in both cases be seen as a struggle over [Ownership](ownership). As [Capture](capture) is most often done through the actions of a game element under a player's control, determining what game elements can be used to [Capture](capture) is usually a part of defining the goal.",
            "The game design must support some action that facilitates the [Capture](capture). In the case of [Real-Time Games](real-time-games), this typically is [Combat](combat), [Maneuvering](maneuvering), or [Aim & Shoot](aim-shoot) promoting skills in [Dexterity-Based Actions](dexterity-based-actions). [Turn-Based Games](turn-based-games) favor the use of [Puzzle Solving](puzzle-solving), and thereby [Stimulated Planning](stimulated-planning), but can also make use of [Investment](investments) or [Bidding](bidding). The first type of game usually has the subgoal of [Contact](contact) (with \"Qix\" as an example of [Enclosure](enclosure)) while the second type of game commonly has subgoals such as [Contact](contact), [Alignment](alignment), [Enclosure](enclosure), [Configuration](configuration), and [Connection](connection)."
        ],
        "consequences": [
            "[Capture](capture) goals are very often related to [Overcome](overcome) goals in the \"Hierarchies of Goals\". How they are related to each other depends primarily on their individual [Reward](rewards) structures and on players' tactics. [Capture](capture) is often achieved by [Movement](movement) but in [Real-Time Games](real-time-games), this depends on [Timing](timing), while in [Turn-Based Games](turn-based-games), it more often is a form of [Puzzle Solving](puzzle-solving), as players have to take other players or [Agents](agents) actions into consideration due to [Turn Taking](turn-taking).",
            "[Captures](capture) combined with [Eliminate](eliminate) of game elements that are [Non-Renewable Resources](non-renewable-resources) can quicken gameplay as fewer game elements remain and promote [Higher-Level Closures as Gameplay Progresses](higher-level-closuresas-gameplay-progresses) since each element represents a greater part of players' [Resources](resources). When [Capture](capture) allows [Transfer of Control](transferof-control), this causes [Preventing Goals](preventing-goals) such as [Evade](evade) and can trigger retaliating [Capture](capture) goals by an original owner to regain control. The control of a new game element through [Capture](capture) can motivate [New Abilities](new-abilities), possibly [Privileged Abilities](privileged-abilities), to become available."
