        "definition": "Goals that require the player to maintain a subset of a certain game state within certain limits.",
        "description": [
            "Continuous Goals are goals which are achieved by making sure a given condition is maintained for a certain period of time. Rather than just having to fulfill a condition at a specific point in gameplay, the player must ensure that the condition is not broken through passiveness, game events, or other players' actions. Many, if not most, of the games having [Continuous Goals](continuous-goals) also have as subgoal to first reach the required game state condition of the [Continuous Goal](continuous-goals)."

        "examples": [
            "Multiplayer first-person shooters such as \"Battlefield 1942\" have modes where teams score points (or reduce ticks from the opposing team) by controlling strategic locations.",
            "the goal for the king in [King of the Hill](kingofthe-hill) is to maintain the game state of being the king while the other players have the goal of changing that game state. The same situation appears in \"Tag\", but reversed; the chasing player, \"it\", has a goal to change the game state by role reversalwhile the other players try to maintain the state."

        "usage": [
            "[Continuous Goals](continuous-goals) can easily be constructed by modifying the scoring mechanics of a goal so that they do not depend on the fulfillment of a game state but rather on maintaining a game state. [Preventing Goals](preventing-goals) are [Continuous Goals](continuous-goals) since basically they are defined as maintaining the game state which is the inversion of the game state of the goal to be prevented. Examples of [Continuous Goals](continuous-goals) are [Reconnaissance](reconnaissance), [Guard](guard), and [King of the Hill](kingofthe-hill), of which the two latter make use of [Goal Points](goal-points). Other examples are maintaining [Indirect Control](indirect-control) of game elements or [Area Control](area-control) of parts of the [Game World](game-world). [Planned Character Development](planned-character-development) is a [Continuous Goal](continuous-goals) since it usually requires many actions and subgoals to be perform while continually striving for the goal. [Continuous Goals](continuous-goals) can also be defined negatively, e. g. as not performing an otherwise possible and maybe beneficial action.",
            "Unless there is a risk of the game state to be lost, [Continuous Goals](continuous-goals) can become uninteresting. This can be avoided by making the [Continuous Goal](continuous-goals) also be a [Preventing Goal](preventing-goals). A typical way to create this risk is to use [Survive](survive) as a \"Continuous Goal,\" which is a [Preventing Goal](preventing-goals) to other players' [Eliminate](eliminate) goal.",
            "[Continuous Goals](continuous-goals) can be completed if they are combined with [Preventing Goals](preventing-goals) or if they are limited by [Time Limits](time-limits) but not all [Continuous Goals](continuous-goals) have end conditions. These latter kinds of [Continuous Goals](continuous-goals) are usually [Races](race) between players were the level of success of the [Continuous Goal](continuous-goals) determines the winner of the race. This can be achieved by measuring and comparing how long a player has been able to maintain the required game state compared to other players.",
            "[Continuous Goals](continuous-goals) modulate the use of [Penalties](penalties) and [Rewards](rewards) by threatening with [Penalties](penalties) as soon as the player fails some action while waiting with [Rewards](rewards) until some additional requirement is met. For example, players may be threatened by [Ability Losses](ability-losses) if failing the [Continuous Goal](continuous-goals) of keeping [Units](units) alive but do not have any explicit end conditions which led to [Rewards](rewards) specifically for keeping the [Units](units) alive."
        ],
        "consequences": [
            "[Continuous Goals](continuous-goals) create natural \"Hierarchies of Goals\" with the goal of achieving the game state that is to be maintained in the [Continuous Goal](continuous-goals). These goals are a way to expand the [Tension](tension) of a non-continuous goal; although the closure of achieving the game state of the latter still exists, this is primarily a prerequisite for the [Continuous Goal](continuous-goals) and the player must continue to struggle to benefit from the achievement. This can either require player to make explicit [Extended Actions](extended-actions) or perform a number of different actions, which can be seen as implicit compound [Extended Actions](extended-actions), that maintain the game state within certain boundaries.",
            "[Continuous Goals](continuous-goals) are by nature [Hovering Closures](hovering-closures). If the player can affect the game state so that the [Continuous Goal](continuous-goals) no longer is maintained, this can be seen as a deliberate [Hovering Closure](hovering-closures)."
