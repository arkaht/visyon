            "The first arcade game to have [High Score Lists](high-score-lists) was \"Asteroids\". The player who achieves a high enough score compared to the other players of the same machine is allowed to enter his initials to be displayed in the [High Score List](high-score-lists)."

        "usage": [
            "The use of [High Score Lists](high-score-lists) is fairly standardized, with the main design choices being the number of [Scores](score) saved in the [High Score List](high-score-lists) and how [Handles](handles) are supported. Most [High Score Lists](high-score-lists) make use of [Handles](handles) so that the players can identify their own scores and know that other players can recognize them. Since [High Score Lists](high-score-lists) typically are ordered, they need [Tiebreakers](tiebreakers) or have to be explicitly designed to allow several players with [Tied Results](tied-results) to be displayed as completely equal.",
            "The use of [Ghosts](ghosts) can be seen as a form of [High Score List](high-score-lists) that allows players to judge their progress against other performances, as well as their own individual performances, in previous game sessions while playing the game."

        "consequences": [
            "[High Score Lists](high-score-lists) create a [Meta Game](meta-games) out of the game by using [Trans-Game Information](trans-game-information), allowing players to have [Player Defined Goals](player-defined-goals) such as to rank themselves against previous achievements, and thereby encouraging [Game Mastery](game-mastery). Doing so adds [Replayability](replayability) to the game, as the players have the additional goal of simply performing slightly better than in the previous game sessions. [High Score Lists](high-score-lists) are also a simple way to introduce [Competition](competition) to otherwise [Single-Player Games](single-player-games) and are also a way for players to compare and display their [Social Statuses](social-statuses)."
