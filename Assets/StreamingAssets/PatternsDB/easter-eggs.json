        "description": [
            "[Easter Eggs](easter-eggs) are surprises put in games that do not necessarily advance the game story or even fit within the reality of the [Game World](game-world). The design of [Easter Eggs](easter-eggs) started as programmers' and game designers' ways of protesting against management but soon turned into a gameplay value, encouraging exploration and people to replay the games."
        ],
        "examples": [
            "The first documented [Easter Egg](easter-eggs) was the text \"Created by Robinett.\" in \"Adventure\" put there by the programmer Warren Robinett. To find it, players had first to find a single dot object that had the same color as the background of the game and was located in a room that was inaccessible unless you used a special bridge. This dot then had to be carried to a specific wall to let the players enter a secret room which contained the message.",
            "\"Super Mario Bros.\" included entire levels as [Easter Eggs](easter-eggs), including an underwater world that was seemingly endless.",
            "The whole game\"Maniac Mansion\" is included as an [Easter Egg](easter-eggs) in its sequel \"Day of the Tentacle\"."
        ],
        "usage": [
            "Designing [Easter Eggs](easter-eggs) includes choosing where in the [Game World](game-world) they exist, what they contain, creating possible [Clues](clues) to ease finding them, and making sure they are [Optional Goals](optional-goals). Typical contents of [Easter Eggs](easter-eggs) include [Games within Games](gameswithin-games) or [Resources](resources) to modulate the [Right Level of Difficulty](right-levelof-difficulty). The use of [Games within Games](gameswithin-games) and other [Easter Eggs](easter-eggs) that effectively change the mode of play may be more suitable in [Single-Player Games](single-player-games), since there is no need to try and synchronize and explain changes of play mode in these types of games."
        ],
        "consequences": [
            "[Easter Eggs](easter-eggs) are a way of providing [Surprises](surprises) in games, which are extra-game rewards in addition to any other benefits they give. Knowledge about their existence provides [Optional Goals](optional-goals) of [Exploration](exploration) and may stimulate [Social Interaction](social-interaction) between game sessions to pass [Trans-Game Information](trans-game-information). [Easter Eggs](easter-eggs) may even promote [Replayability](replayability), since players can have [Player Defined Goals](player-defined-goals) to find all [Easter Eggs](easter-eggs) even after completing a game. The [Consistent Reality Logic](consistent-reality-logic) of an [Alternative Reality](alternative-reality) can be negatively affected by [Easter Eggs](easter-eggs) unless they only consist of [Resources](resources) or purely aesthetic effects."
