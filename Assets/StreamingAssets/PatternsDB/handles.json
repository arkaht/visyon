        "definition": "The players are identified in the game instance, and sometimes between game instances, by short names or other at least somewhat unique identifiers.",
        "description": [
            "The players are often free to choose their own [Handles](handles), unless there already are similar [Handles](handles) in the game. The requirement of a unique identifier within a game instance is usually quite strict, even if the game system itself does not guarantee the uniqueness of the [Handle](handles). The same applies to more persistent [Handles](handles) between game instances."
        ],
        "examples": [
            "\"Asteroids\" and many, if not most, other arcade games have highscore lists where the players can leave their short nick-names if they perform well enough in the game. The players can enter any [Handle](handles) in the highscore list, but it is often considered quite impolite to use the same [Handle](handles) as someone else.",
            "online multiplayer first-person shooters let the players enter names for their avatars. These [Handles](handles) are used to measure and compare the performance of the individual players and in team-oriented games also to identify the other team-members. The [Handles](handles) are not necessarily persistent from the game system point of view, but often there are sometimes severe penalties for players who try to pose as other players."
        ],
        "usage": [
            "The [Handles](handles) in many cases are just short free-form pieces of text but can be linked not only to players but to whole [Characters](characters). The classic limit of three characters per [Handle](handles) is sometimes still used in current arcade games. Games with predefined roles for the players can let the players select their [Handles](handles) from a predefined list. In these cases the [Handle](handles) is also used to identify the players' different roles and abilities in the game. Online games for children, such as \"ToonTown\", let the players compose their [Handles](handles) from predefined list of words to avoid the possibility of obscene [Handles](handles). [Handles](handles) can carry also extra information about the players, for example, their [Social Status](social-statuses) or if they belong to a [Social Organizations](social-organizations) such as clans or guilds."
        ],
        "consequences": [
            "[Handles](handles) are used to identify different players in cases where differentiation would otherwise be impossible or difficult. Besides supporting [Team Play](team-play), players are often willing to identify themselves in order to compare and show off their [Game Mastery](game-mastery) to other players and [Spectators](spectators) in games with quantifiable measurements of performance, such as [Score](score), in order to accrue [Social Status](social-statuses). \"Highscore Lists\" are a prime example of this use of [Handles](handles), allowing players to compare the outcomes of their game instances with other players. These kinds of persistent [Handles](handles) are used to carry [Trans-Game Information](trans-game-information) between game instances.",
            "Another reason for persistent [Handles](handles) is that the players can form more stable [Social Organizations](social-organizations) where the players may have different roles and responsibilities. [Persistent Game Worlds](persistent-game-worlds) almost have to have some methods of identifying the other players and [Handles](handles) is the simplest one of these. [Handles](handles) provide simple means for [Identification](identification) within the game for the players and heightens the [Emotional Immersion](emotional-immersion)."
