        "definition": "Ownership dictates which of the players have access to the Resources and other game components and how.",
        "description": [
            "Often the [Ownership](ownership) in games is tied to specific game elements used as [Resources](resources), but the same principles can also be applied to goals, information, and even player-to-player relationships. The most intuitive one, of course, is the [Ownership](ownership) of concrete game elements such as pieces in a board game or cards in card games. The [Ownership](ownership) can also vary between being persistent even between game instances, as in \"Magic: The Gathering\" and other collectable card games, to being permanent within the game instance, as with the pieces in \"Chess\", to being variable within the game instance, as with the basic resources in \"Settlers of Catan\"."
        ],
        "examples": [
            "In \"Chess\", the players have 16 pieces each, the [Ownership](ownership) is indicated by the color of these pieces, and the [Ownership](ownership) governs that only the player that owns the piece can move it on his turn, and that only pieces owned by the opposing player can be captured. The pieces are used to claim [Ownership](ownership) of the grids of the chessboard.",
            "In \"Diplomacy\", the players can claim [Ownership](ownership) of the areas by occupying them with armies. The areas owned by a player are used to calculate the amount of armies and fleets the player can control. Also, only the owner of the army or the fleet can command it.",
            "In collectable card games such as \"Magic: The Gathering\", the player may own hundreds or even thousands of different cards, and one of the main reasons for playing the game is the sense of [Ownership](ownership) of such a collection. The collection is used to create the decks used in single game instances and, naturally, the more cards the player owns the better possibilities there are for creating the decks used in play.",
            "\"Settlers of Catan\" incorporates several layers of [Ownership](ownership). The most basic one is the [Ownership](ownership) of basic [Resources](resources), which are used to build roads, settlements, and cities, and to buy special development cards. The player, naturally, has [Ownership](ownership) of these elements as well. The player building the longest continuous road claims the [Ownership](ownership) of the longest road card and the player having most armies claims the [Ownership](ownership) of the largest army card. The [Ownership](ownership) of these cards is used to calculate victory points."
        ],
        "usage": [
            "[Ownership](ownership) is mainly used in games to provide goals for players, provide [Resources](resources) needed to continue performing actions, or give [Privileged Abilities](privileged-abilities) for owning specific [Tools](tools) or [Producers](producers). In some games, the players can also share the [Ownership](ownership) of other game components such as [Mutual Goals](mutual-goals) or information. The game can have several different [Resources](resources) with several different [Ownership](ownership) structures. Some of these [Ownership](ownership) structures require that the design of both the game itself and the [Meta Game](meta-games) level take them into account. For example, most collectable card games in which the [Ownership](ownership) of the cards is persistent between game instances have [Trading](trading) on the [Meta Game](meta-games) level or have [Extra-Game Consequences](extra-game-consequences) in a form of [Betting](betting).",
            "[Ownership](ownership) can either be permanent in game instances or change due to [Transfer of Control](transferof-control) events. Having permanent [Ownership](ownership) within one game instance is often used in games with [Non-Renewable Resources](non-renewable-resources), such as \"Chess\", where the [Ownership](ownership) of the game pieces is fixed at the start of the game and remains fixed until the end of the game or until the pieces are captured and removed from play. Card games almost invariably use [Card Hands](card-hands) where the [Ownership](ownership) usually dictates that only the player owning the [Card Hand](card-hands) has [Perfect Information](perfect-information) of the cards and can use the cards in play. The composition of the [Card Hand](card-hands), however, can change radically during the game. [Investments](investments) are an interesting use of [Ownership](ownership) where [Ownership](ownership) of a [Resource](resources) is renounced for a while in order to later claim [Ownership](ownership) of the [Rewards](rewards) of the [Investments](investments). It can be said that [Investments](investments) are speculative [Ownership](ownership) structures.",
            "[Ownership](ownership) can be used to motivate many types of goals in games. The most obvious goal related to [Ownership](ownership) is naturally [Gain Ownership](gain-ownership), where the objective is to achieve [Transfer of Control](transferof-control) of the goal object to the player. [Capture](capture), [Guard](guard), and [Rescue](rescue) are also goals that usually involve either the [Transfer of Control](transferof-control) of the goal object or prevention of the [Transfer of Control](transferof-control). These goals are likely to cause C\"onflict\", especially if they cause [Player Killing](player-killing). [Collection](collection) as a goal naturally involves the use of [Ownership](ownership) for both the parts of the [Collection](collection) and for completing the [Collection](collection) itself. This is evident especially in cases where the [Ownership](ownership) is persistent from game instance to game instance as in Collectable Card Games. \"Pokï¿½mon\" is also an excellent example of using the completion of a [Collection](collection) as an overarching goal of the game.",
            "As for goals, \"Ownership---\" or the possibility of [Ownership](ownership) ---can motivate players to perform many forms of actions. [Trading](trading), both between the players and with the game system, is based on [Ownership](ownership) as [Trading](trading) involves [Transfer of Control](transferof-control). Actions to gain [Area Control](area-control), even in its simplest forms, are also dependent on Ownership. For example, the piece can be said to own the grid it is standing on. More complex forms of [Ownership](ownership) in [Area Control](area-control) involve explicit [Transfer of Control](transferof-control) of the areas as is done in many strategy games, such as \"Diplomacy\" and \"Europa Universalis\". In some of the strategy games, the [Ownership](ownership) structures of the areas are complex, where the players can also give partial [Ownership](ownership) of the areas, for example, rights to move armies through the areas or even to make the areas [Shared Resources](shared-resources), where the other players have the same [Ownership](ownership) rights to the area as well.",
            "[Asymmetric Resource Distribution](asymmetric-resource-distribution) and [Symmetric Resource Distribution](symmetric-resource-distribution) can be used to create different [Ownership](ownership) structures for different players and motivate both [Gain Ownership](gain-ownership) goals and [Trading](trading) actions. [Ownership](ownership) can also be shared between many players, as is done in games based on [Shared Resources](shared-resources)."

        "consequences": [
            "Sense of [Ownership](ownership) is a strong basic human emotion, and [Ownership](ownership) can be used to create [Tension](tension) in the game as is evident in games involving loss of [Ownership](ownership) as a threat. [Ownership](ownership) is also one of the cornerstones for deepening the [Emotional Immersion](emotional-immersion) in the game and achieving [Identification](identification) through, for example, using [Avatar](avatars) s in [Persistent Game Worlds.](persistent-game-worlds) The [Tension](tension) and [Emotional Immersion](emotional-immersion) caused by [Ownership](ownership) is however reduced for [Renewable Resources](renewable-resources) compared to [Non-Renewable Resources](non-renewable-resources).",
            "Besides [Ownership](ownership) that games explicitly have given to players, feelings of [Ownership](ownership) are likely to occur of game elements produced by [Producers](producers) under the players' control, or even stronger, when players have had [Creative Control](creative-control) of game elements or other aspects of the [Game World](game-world)."
