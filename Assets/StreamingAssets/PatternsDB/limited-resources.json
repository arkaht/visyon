    "name": "Limited Resources",
    "texts": {
        "definition": "The resources available to the players are limited to such extent that they are forced to plan ahead the use of the resources, that is, there is a perceivable possibility of running out of the resources during the game play.",
        "description": [
            "For games that use resources to possess the right level of challenge the availability of resource has to be restricted. This means that players have [Limited Resources](limited-resources) in some sense and have to make use of them in the most efficient way to play the game as well as possible."
        ],
        "examples": [
            "in \"Chess\" the players have sixteen pieces each and there is a clear threat of losing these resources.",
            "even though it is possible to build more troops in \"WarCraft\" the game is balanced in such way that there is always a need for planning the use of the troops and also a feeling of the possibility of running out of them."
        ],
        "usage": [
            "[Limited Resources](limited-resources) can be used together with both [Non-Renewable Resources](non-renewable-resources) and [Renewable Resources](renewable-resources). The main point in both cases is, however, to control the amount of [Resources](resources) available to the player at any certain point of gameplay in such way that the player is always forced to plan and to make [Tradeoffs](tradeoffs) when using the [Resources](resources). This is often used by having some form of [Container](container) that limits the amount of [Resources](resources) available, and the capacity of the [Container](container), in turn, can be modulated by [Improved Abilities](improved-abilities) or [Decreased Abilities](decreased-abilities) to modulate how limited the [Resources](resources) are. Ways of combining [Limited Resources](limited-resources) and [Renewable Resources](renewable-resources) may be that it is possible to gain new [Resources](resources) from [Pick-Ups](pick-ups) or [Resource Generators](resource-generators) but either the [Resources](resources) must be used far from these or that the amount of [Renewable Resources](renewable-resources) are limited.",
            "[Limited Resources](limited-resources) can be used, for example through [Time Limits](time-limits) or [Budgeted Action Points](budgeted-action-points), to lessen [Downtime](downtime) and potential imbalances between players in games with [Turn Taking](turn-taking)."
        ],
        "consequences": [
            "[Limited Resources](limited-resources) decrease players' [Freedom of Choice](freedomof-choice). In principle all games have [Limited Resources](limited-resources), but often some of the [Resources](resources) are more limited than the others forcing the player to plan and form strategies about the use of these resources. The amount of available [Resources](resources) limits the possible actions and strategies of the players, and thereby their [Freedom of Choice](freedomof-choice). Limiting the amount of [Resources](resources) available to the player reduces the potential actions possible for the player, increases [Stimulated Planning](stimulated-planning) and, in some cases, gives a method to avoid [Analysis Paralysis](analysis-paralysis). Planning how to use [Limited Resources](limited-resources) is one of the corner stones of [Resource Management](resource-management) and skill in making most use of [Limited Resources](limited-resources), and especially in making correct [Risk/Reward](risk-reward) judgments and often basis for [Game Mastery](game-mastery).",
            "Some form of [Limited Resources](limited-resources), typically health, is a requirement for the design of [Last Man Standing](last-man-standing) goals."
