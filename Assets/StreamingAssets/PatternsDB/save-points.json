        "definition": "Save Points are the points in gameplay where the players can choose to save the game state so that they can return to it later.",
        "description": [
            "[Save Points](save-points) do not need to be physical places as a game may only provide players with the option to save game position between levels, i. e. in pauses in gameplay. [Save Points](save-points) have typically been most common in games for consoles as the storage capacity for the consoles has been more limited than in personal computers."

        "examples": [
            "\"Final Fantasy VII\" has specific locations where the player can save the current game state."
        ],
        "usage": [
            "[Save Points](save-points) are the locations in games where players can save the game, and they thereby control how players can perform [Save-Load Cycles](save-load-cycles). The [Save Points](save-points) can be used to achieve the [Right Level of Difficulty](right-levelof-difficulty). For example, if a more difficult game is required, place [Save Points](save-points) in such way that it demands the players to complete a \"Hierarchy of goals\" or a long sequence of actions before saving. This spreading out of the available [Save Points](save-points) can increase the [Tension](tension) as the players have larger investments in time and effort before reaching a [Save Point](save-points) and, in some cases, can also frustrate the player if the difficulty level for reaching a [Save Point](save-points) is too high. Locating the [Save Points](save-points) in the [Game World](game-world) automatically creates [Traverse](traverse) goals.",
            "Older computer games used a form of [Save Points](save-points) where level codes were given to the player after completing a [Level](levels) so that one did not have to replay those [Levels](levels) in later game sessions. However, this did not allow the players to maintain any other information about the previous game sessions, thereby making the use of [Score](score) more difficult."
        ],
        "consequences": [
            "[Save Points](save-points) are nearly always [Safe Havens](safe-havens), i. e. once the [Save Points](save-points) have been reached the player does not have to face any immediate threats and can relax. Even if they are not explicitly created as [Safe Havens](safe-havens), they at least allow players to save the current game state and let them have infinitely many tries to continue playing from that location. Depending on how savingis done, [Save Points](save-points) can be [Closure Points](closure-points)."
