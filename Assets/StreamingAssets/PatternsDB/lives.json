        "definition": "Lives can be defined as the number of chances a player has within a game session before it is terminated.",
        "description": [
            "The loss of an individual \"Life\" is usually also associated with at least some negative effects in the game."
        ],
        "examples": [
            "\"Counter-Strike\" is sometimes regarded as the first multiplayer first-person shooter that made explicit use of [Lives](lives). The player's [Avatar](avatars) that was killed did not respawn, and the player had to wait until the next level started, in principle, giving each player one \"Life\".",
            "Platform games such as \"Super Mario\" and \"The Legend of Zelda\" series make use of [Lives](lives) but in such way that the only consequence of losing all [Lives](lives) is that the player will have to restart from the latest saved location.",
            "In \"Asteroids\", the player initially has three [Lives](lives), and they are lost either when the [Avatar](avatars) is shot by the UFO or collides with an asteroid. When all [Lives](lives) have been lost, it is the end of the game session."
        ],
        "usage": [
            "[Lives](lives) are typically associated with [Avatars](avatars), but games using [Units](units) can also be regarded as using [Lives](lives) through the use of [Parallel Lives](parallel-lives). The main considerations when introducing [Lives](lives) in a game are: what can cause the loss of a \"Life\", what are the consequences of losing a \"Life\", and how many [Lives](lives) are available. The loss of a \"Life\" is always a [Penalty](penalties), but the effect can vary. The loss of all [Lives](lives) typically signifies the end of the game session for that player, but in games that allow players to join the game instance later, the player may simply start a new game session. The loss of a \"Life\" usually means that [Tools](tools) are lost or that the player's [Score](score) is reduced but may also signify the loss of [New Abilities](new-abilities) and [Privileged Abilities](privileged-abilities) or require players to have a certain amount of [Downtime](downtime) before the gameplay can resume.",
            "The number of [Lives](lives) a player has can be set to a static number to limit the time of the game session. Alternatively, the [Lives](lives) can be replenished during gameplay, for example, by reaching a certain [Score](score) or collecting [Pick-Ups](pick-ups). The possibility to replenish [Lives](lives) gives the players clear short-term goals and makes [Lives](lives) into [Renewable Resources](renewable-resources). The use of [Lives](lives) can be modulated by [Damage](damage) to allow [Status Indicators](status-indicators) and partial [Penalties](penalties) before more significant penalties occur.",
            "Losses of [Lives](lives) are typically the effects of [Deadly Traps](deadly-traps), failing to [Evade](evade) actions by [Enemies](enemies) or players in [Conflict](conflict) with the player, or failing to replenish [Resources](resources) within a certain [Time Limit](time-limits). Typically, only one \"Life\" is at stake at a time (although some games may refer to [Lives](lives) when they are actually using something similar to hit points), but games using [Parallel Lives](parallel-lives) are an exception.",
            "Once the player has suffered the consequences of losing one but not all [Lives](lives), gameplay continues as the [Avatar](avatars) respawns somewhere in the [Game World](game-world). The location where the [Avatar](avatars) respawns can be the point of death, which provides continuation but may have [Player Balance](player-balance) problems since the cause of death may still be present. The [Avatar](avatars) may also spawn in a random location in the [Game World](game-world) or a pre-determined [Spawn Point](spawn-points). If the game design uses [Spawn Points](spawn-points), the specific point may be determined randomly, according to an algorithm to provide [Player Balance](player-balance), or the player may be allowed to select from a set of [Spawn Points](spawn-points).",
            "Common goals closely related to the use of [Lives](lives) are [Last Man Standing](last-man-standing) and [King of the Hill](kingofthe-hill)."
        ],
        "consequences": [
            "[Lives](lives) are a form of [Resources](resources) that allow players to participate in the game as long as players have at least one life left. [Lives](lives) give the players a clear [Continuous Goal](continuous-goals): to [Survive](survive) against [Damage](damage) from [Deadly Traps](deadly-traps) or [Combat](combat) against [Enemies](enemies) or other players, in the case of games with [Player Killing](player-killing) and [Player Elimination](player-elimination).",
            "As [Lives](lives) are typically linked to [Avatars](avatars) or [Characters](characters), they are a way to link the players' successes and failures in the game to those of their [Avatar](avatars) or [Character](characters). If players have emotional links to the [Avatars](avatars) or [Characters](characters), the risk of losing [Lives](lives) increases the [Emotional Immersion](emotional-immersion). Regardless of this, the presence of [Lives](lives) can increase [Tension](tension), as players have something easy to relate to that can be lost in the game.",
            "As multiple [Lives](lives) do not exist in reality, the use of them in games can break a [Consistent Reality Logic](consistent-reality-logic), not only by players having several lives but also through the process of [Spawning](spawning)."
