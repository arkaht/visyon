        "examples": [
            "Speed boosters in \"Super Monkey Ball II: Monkey Race\" give, as their names imply, more speed to the player driving on top of the charger.",
            "\"Battlefield 1942\" and \"Battlefield Vietnam\" have two categories of chargers: medicine cabinets and ammunition caches that replenish the health and ammunition of the players' [Avatars](avatars) and repair facilities that fix damages to vehicles.",

        "usage": [
            "Selecting the [Improved Abilities](improved-abilities), the [New Abilities](new-abilities), and possibly [Privileged Abilities](privileged-abilities), or [Resource](resources) gained defines the use of the [Charger](chargers). The way it produces [Resources](resources) is similar to [Resource Generators](resource-generators) except that players usually do not have any choice if they should be affected by the [Charger](chargers) (besides not entering its affect area), and any [Privileged Ability](privileged-abilities) granted by the [Charger](chargers) may be activated at once, for example, as in the case of speed boosters in most racing games. [Improved Abilities](improved-abilities) can be handled by simply increasing [Skills](skills) or increasing the effect of player actions."

        "consequences": [
            "[Chargers](chargers) provide means for players to get [New Abilities](new-abilities) or [Improved Abilities](improved-abilities) as well as providing [Renewable Resources](renewable-resources).",
            "They function as both [Resource Locations](resource-locations) and [Resource Generators](resource-generators) but do not produce any [Resources](resources) unless a player is within the area, which may require [Maneuvering](maneuvering) to get to. They are typically used to give the player [Renewable Resources](renewable-resources), which can be used as goals or to set the [Right Level of Complexity](right-levelof-complexity). Their presence in a [Game World](game-world) creates natural [Gain Competence](gain-competence) and [Traverse](traverse) goals.",
            "If the [Charger](chargers) provides a bonus beyond the normal limits, i. e., letting players move faster than otherwise possible, it can be seen as a form of [Power-Up](power-ups) that gives [Privileged Abilities](privileged-abilities). For [Chargers](chargers) that give a certain effect per time unit spent in its effect area, staying on it is a [Risk/Reward](risk-reward) [Tradeoff](tradeoffs) for players as their [Freedom of Choice](freedomof-choice) is limited. If the area that contains the [Charger](chargers) can be controlled so other players cannot access the [Charger](chargers), this can give rise to [Gain Ownership](gain-ownership) goals."
