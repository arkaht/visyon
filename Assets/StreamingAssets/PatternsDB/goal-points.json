        "definition": "Goal Points are locations in the game world which the players can enter in order to complete a goal.",
        "description": [
            "In some cases, for example, racing games, it is sufficient to reach the goal by simply entering the [Goal Point](goal-points) while other games require certain other conditions, such as carrying a particular object, for the goal to be fulfilled."
        ],
        "examples": [
            "All racing games, such as the \"Midtown Madness\" and \"Super Monkey Ball\" series, make use of [Goal Points](goal-points) by having goal lines for completing the race. Reaching the [Goal Point](goal-points) in \"Super Monkey Ball\" is the goal for finishing each of the levels.",
            "Capture-the-Flag variants of multiplayer first-person shooters, such as in some variants of Quake and Unreal Tournament, have certain areas where the enemy flag has to be delivered for the team to score."
        ],
        "usage": [
            "The choice of using [Goal Points](goal-points) in a game depends strongly on the particular context for the goals (typically [Traverse](traverse), [Delivery](delivery) or [Herd](herd)) it supports. Defining the location of a [Goal Point](goal-points) in relation to where the pursuit of the goal started is one of the main ways to ensure the [Right Level of Difficulty](right-levelof-difficulty) for that goal. However, these goals do not have to have static locations as [Goal Points](goal-points), and instead of only one [Goal Point](goal-points) there may be several.",
            "The location of a [Goal Point](goal-points) can be placed in an [Inaccessible Areas](inaccessible-areas) to make the completion more difficult as it either requires the completion of subgoals before the goal can be reached or the use of [Privileged Abilities](privileged-abilities) of [Units](units) (or [Avatars](avatars) in multiplayer games with teams)."
        ],
        "consequences": [
            "[Goal Points](goal-points) create explicit areas to move towards in [Game Worlds](game-world) and thereby make players do [Game World Navigation](game-world-navigation). They create an explicit end condition to strive towards in [Exploration](exploration), [Traverse](traverse), [Delivery](delivery), and [Herd](herd) goals. Both the success and the failure of reaching a goal with a[Goal Point](goal-points) has strong closures, and the easy measure of the level of failure through the spatial distance to the [Goal Point](goal-points) creates a [Near Miss Indicator](near-miss-indicators) through being an intuitive [Progress Indicator](progress-indicators) in the first place.",
            "When combine with [Area Control](area-control) to define [Continuous Goals](continuous-goals), [Goal Points](goal-points) limit player's [Freedom of Choice](freedomof-choice) as they have to be in a certain area as long as the [Continuous Goal](continuous-goals) has to be maintained. This, however, makes the [Goal Point](goal-points) a [Strategic Location](strategic-locations) and the objective for [Gain Ownership](gain-ownership) goals. When several [Goal Points](goal-points) simultaneously have to be held this requires players to do [Collaborative Actions](collaborative-actions).",
            "[Goal Points](goal-points) can be combined with [Safe Havens](safe-havens) to let player release [Tension](tension) after reaching a closure."
