        "definition": "Privileged Abilities are those that let players perform actions that are not readily available to all other players.",
        "description": [
            "Many games have different sets of actions possible for different players. The actions one player has, or possibly a few players have, are [Privileged Abilities](privileged-abilities) in that they allow different tactics and often different forms of goals to be sought."
        ],
        "examples": [
            "Computer roleplaying games, such as \"Neverwinter Nights\" and \"Diablo\", make use of [Privileged Abilities](privileged-abilities) by making certain actions only available to specific classes, for example, only allowing wizards to cast spells.",
            "Online multiplayer first-person shooters such \"as Return to Castle Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory\" or \"Battlefield 1942\" use the same method of dividing special abilities, such as repairing vehicles or providing air strikes, to specific classes. \"Return to Castle Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory\" further provides new actions as players gain experience in various activities.",
            "The board game \"History of the World\" uses cards with special abilities that can be played only on certain turns in order to loosely follow the historical development of civilizations."
        ],
        "usage": [
            "The design choices regarding [Privileged Abilities](privileged-abilities) can be divided into three main categories: the actual nature of the action, how the action is made available, and which player has access to the action.",
            "[Privileged Abilities](privileged-abilities) can take many different forms, but common ones allow players to move differently than other players, avoid the effects of [Penalties](penalties), allow special actions in [Combat](combat), create [Resources](resources), manipulate the [Resource Management](resource-management) system in the game, create [Asymmetric Information](asymmetric-information) states by providing additional access to information, or affect the outcome of other actions. Examples are numerous: ordinary attacks and [Combos](combos) for use in [Combat](combat); movement enhancement such as speed of movement or ability to jump longer, or in other ways making it easier to ignore or avoid [Obstacles](obstacles); [Privileged Movement](privileged-movement) in the form of flying, swimming, or diving; activation of armor or invulnerability that make the effect of [Damage](damage) little or none to avoiding [Penalties](penalties), perhaps automatic when [Spawning](spawning); being a [Producer](producers) of [Renewable Resources](renewable-resources), for example to create health packs that remove [Damage](damage), or being able to employ [Construction](construction); for [Resource Management](resource-management), actions that affect [Resource](resources) [Collecting](collecting) for example enabling card pick-up from the [Discard Pile](discard-piles) instead of the [Drawing Stack](drawing-stacks); for information, having [Units](units) with less [Fog of War](fogof-war) than other [Units](units) or being allowed to look at another player's [Card Hand](card-hands); for outcomes, control of [Player-Decided Distribution of Rewards & Penalties](player-decided-distributionof-rewards-penalties) or possession of replay and cancellation cards that force a new evaluation of the action or that a new action is taken instead of the one that has just taken place. In some cases, even the option of performing a [No-Op](no-ops) action can be a [Privileged Ability](privileged-abilities).",
            "[Privileged Abilities](privileged-abilities) that are present from the beginning of the game allow players to perform extra-game activities in planning strategies if these actions are known or can be chosen. Those [Privileged Abilities](privileged-abilities) that are gained during gameplay can provide [Stimulated Planning](stimulated-planning), including \"Planned\" [Character Development](character-development) and [Team Development](team-development), and gaining the abilities is often done through some form of [Investment](investments). [Privileged Abilities](privileged-abilities) that only can be used or are useful during certain parts of the game put players under a [Time Limit](time-limits) and strengthen the importance of [Timing](timing) the actions.",
            "[Area Control](area-control), [Chargers](chargers), and [Power-Ups](power-ups) can be used to activate [Privileged Abilities](privileged-abilities). In this case, gaining the [Privileged Ability](privileged-abilities) can become a question of knowing [Strategic Locations](strategic-locations), and the activation of [Privileged Ability](privileged-abilities) is tied to a specific location in the game. As the effects of [Chargers](chargers) and [Power-Ups](power-ups) usually are under a [Time Limit](time-limits) or otherwise bounded, the effects on [Player Balance](player-balance) can more easily be controlled than for other types of [Privileged Abilities](privileged-abilities).",
            "[Privileged Abilities](privileged-abilities) may also appear due to [Penalties](penalties) inflicted on other players; the effect of losing your knights in \"Chess\" while your opponent still has them can be seen as if your opponent has the [Privileged Ability](privileged-abilities) of making knights move.",
            "The question of who has access to the [Privileged Ability](privileged-abilities) can be split into the questions of what [Focus Loci](focus-loci) provides the action and which players have access to the action. When using [Avatars](avatars) representing [Characters](characters) as the [Focus Loci](focus-loci), the [Privileged Abilities](privileged-abilities) can be represented by [Skills](skills) to allow further modulation of the abilities.",
            "The choice of [Focus Loci](focus-loci) affects how player's can experience [Ability Loss](ability-losses). If the [Privileged Abilities](privileged-abilities) are provided by [Avatars](avatars) or [Characters](characters), the loss is typically either due to the end of a [Time Limit](time-limits) in the case of [Power-Ups](power-ups) or a [Penalty](penalties) for losing a \"Life\" or losing [Ownership](ownership) of [Tools](tools). Besides allowing for [Orthogonal Unit Differentiation](orthogonal-unit-differentiation), [Tools](tools) and [Units](units) allow the [Privileged Abilities](privileged-abilities) to shift between players by different forms of [Transfer of Control](transferof-control), e. g., stealing.",
            "The affect of which player has the [Privileged Abilities](privileged-abilities) depends heavily upon whether the game involves [Team Play](team-play). In [Team Play](team-play), the [Privileged Ability](privileged-abilities) of a player can be matched by the same [Privileged Ability](privileged-abilities) in the other teams to create [Player Balance](player-balance). This makes the teams have symmetric abilities while providing [Asymmetric Abilities](asymmetric-abilities) within the team and allows individual players to have game-controlled [Competence Areas](competence-areas). In games without teams but with [Cooperation](cooperation), the pattern can also support [Competence Areas](competence-areas), while in games with [Conflict](conflict), it is more likely to affect [Player Balance](player-balance).",
            "Possible affects on [Player Balance](player-balance) by [Privileged Abilities](privileged-abilities) can be mitigated somewhat if they are part of the set of actions selectable by [Budgeted Action Points](budgeted-action-points)."
        ],
        "consequences": [
            "[Privileged Abilities](privileged-abilities) give players [Empowerment](empowerment) in games since they have abilities that others do not. This is especially apparent in [Self-Facilitated Games](self-facilitated-games) that make use of [Game Masters](game-masters), since the entire game state is controlled by them and all events in the game must be approved by them.",
            "By their very nature, [Privileged Abilities](privileged-abilities) create a state of [Asymmetric Abilities](asymmetric-abilities) between players and thereby easily affect [Player Balance](player-balance) and [Team Balance](team-balance). When unsupervised by the game system, this can create greater and greater differences in [Player Balance](player-balance) as gameplay progresses, but by actively modifying what [Privileged Abilities](privileged-abilities) players have and when, e. g., by deciding the nature of a [Power-Up](power-ups) due to the positions of players in a racing game, the pattern can instead be used to support [Player Balance](player-balance).",
            "When combined with [New Abilities](new-abilities), [Privileged Abilities](privileged-abilities) can be used as the goal for [Gain Competence](gain-competence) goals. When tied to [Avatars](avatars) or [Characters](characters), they can be used to explicitly indicate [Character Development](character-development). In games with [Team Play](team-play), this naturally can also affect [Team Development](team-development) and can strengthen the [Competence Area](competence-areas) of players and give them [Social Statuses](social-statuses). Further, it can support stimulated[Social Interaction](social-interaction), as players usually need to coordinate their activities to take full advantage of the set of actions they have. If the [Privileged Abilities](privileged-abilities) are matched between the teams, [Team Balance](team-balance) can be achieved even though [Player Balance](player-balance) may not be.",
            "If competing players can gain access to the same or balancing [Privileged Abilities](privileged-abilities) through completions of similar goals in games using [Competition](competition), a [Red Queen Dilemma](red-queen-dilemmas) situation can occur. In this case, and other cases where players can gain or have had [Privileged Abilities](privileged-abilities) but currently do not, not having the abilities can be a form of [Penalty](penalties)."
