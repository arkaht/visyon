        "examples": [
            "The text-based adventure game \"Zork\" made navigation difficult by having non-symmetric routes between locations: Moving north from a place to another did not means that one returned by going south, rather one might have to go west instead.",
            "The maze-like levels in \"Doom\" and \"Quake\" required player to navigate within the environments to move efficiently between all parts of the levels."

        "usage": [
            "[Game World Navigation](game-world-navigation) is most common in games with large [Game Worlds](game-world) and which support [Spatial Immersion](spatial-immersion). However, games relying on text-based descriptions can have [Game World Navigation](game-world-navigation) and make the action into a [Puzzle Solving](puzzle-solving) one by consciously breaking the [Consistent Reality Logic](consistent-reality-logic) that moving in one direction and then in the opposite direction brings one back to the starting position.",
            "The layout of [Game Worlds](game-world) modulate the[Right Level of Difficulty](right-levelof-difficulty) of navigating and can be made more difficult by [Movement Limitations](movement-limitations), [Obstacles](obstacles),[Inaccessible Areas](inaccessible-areas), and other possibilities for [Leaps of Faith](leapsof-faith), especially if they block players' views to other areas of a [Game World](game-world). The navigation can be made easier by the use of [Outstanding Features](outstanding-features), [Traces](traces), [Clues](clues), and [Game State Overview](game-state-overview) in the forms of maps. The division of [Game Worlds](game-world) into [Levels](levels) makes [Game World Navigation](game-world-navigation) easier as smaller areas have to be navigated. [Privileged Movement](privileged-movement) forms such as flying also makes the navigation easier as players can have better [Game State Overview](game-state-overview) through different perspectives and may remove problems with [Obstacles](obstacles) and [Inaccessible Areas](inaccessible-areas)."

        "consequences": [
            "[Game World Navigation](game-world-navigation) is an activity based upon [Exploration](exploration) goals in [Game Worlds](game-world) done when performing [Movement](movement) where only reaching the [Goal Point](goal-points) is the only point of interest. However, learning the layout of the [Game World](game-world) can be used if the route has to be navigated again and can thus be [Strategic Knowledge](strategic-knowledge).",
            "A certain amount of [Freedom of Choice](freedomof-choice) is necessary for [Game World Navigation](game-world-navigation) to be possible; that is, players must be able to choose wrong directions to move in and have the possibility to get lost for [Game World Navigation](game-world-navigation) to be a purposeful activity. Since [God Views](god-views) let players move their view of the [Game World](game-world) regardless of game elements it makes [Game World Navigation](game-world-navigation) a trivial problem.",
            "[Game World Navigation](game-world-navigation) encourages [Cognitive Immersion](cognitive-immersion) and can actually lessen [Spatial Immersion](spatial-immersion) as it encourages players to perceive the [Game World](game-world) from an abstract perspective rather than through a game element."
