        "definition": "Alarms are abstract game elements that provide information about particular game state changes.",
        "description": [
            "[Alarms](alarms) are turned on and off either by manipulating explicit game elements or by inherent actions of the game elements. [Alarms](alarms) can, for instance, show if a forbidden area has been entered or if a certain game elements have been manipulated."
        ],
        "examples": [
            "Some team-based first-person shooters, such as \"Return to Castle Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory\", include [Alarms](alarms) to inform the players about events that are relevant on a team level, e. g., that a particular goal has been completed or that a certain activity has been initiated by the other team."
        ],
        "usage": [
            "The main design choices for [Alarms](alarms) are how they are tripped and what [Outstanding Features](outstanding-features) they set off. Further when designing [Alarms](alarms), the designer may choose either explicit [Tools](tools) or [Controllers](controllers) to manipulate the [Alarms](alarms) or to have the manipulation of the [Alarms](alarms) as [Privileged Abilities](privileged-abilities) for certain types of [Avatars](avatars) or [Units](units). Using [Tools](tools) or [Controllers](controllers) increases the complexity of the game by allowing such possibilities as deactivating the [Alarm](alarms) when it should not be deactivated, [Bluffing](bluffing) by raising erroneous [Alarms](alarms), and preventing the raising of [Alarms](alarms) by destroying the means to activate them. All these actions increase the player's [Freedom of Choice](freedomof-choice) but may make it more difficult to guarantee the coherent [Narrative Structure](narrative-structures) of the game. Having [Avatars](avatars) or [Units](units) with [Privileged Abilities](privileged-abilities) to raise [Alarms](alarms) may avoid this problem but may break the [Consistent Reality Logic](consistent-reality-logic).",
            "The activation of the [Alarm](alarms) can signify the failure of a [Stealth](stealth) or [Reconnaissance](reconnaissance) goal but can also make the completion of it more difficult by imposing a [Penalty](penalties). This [Penalty](penalties) is often a [Time Limit](time-limits), the introduction of new [Enemies](enemies), or directing existing [Enemies](enemies) to the area where the [Alarm](alarms) was raised."
        ],
        "consequences": [
            "[Alarms](alarms) are ways to pass information about activities and states within a game, and as such provide a [Game State Overview](game-state-overview). When activated by players, an [Alarm](alarms) notifies the players that they have been detected, and this can explain changes in the behavior of [Enemies](enemies) or the introduction of new [Enemies](enemies) within the [Consistent Reality Logic](consistent-reality-logic) of the game. When activated by others, [Alarms](alarms) can notify players of [Enemies](enemies) activities. In both cases, raised [Alarms](alarms) cause [Disruption of Focused Attention](disruptionof-focused-attention)."
