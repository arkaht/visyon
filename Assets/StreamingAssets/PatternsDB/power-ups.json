            " Quad damage [Power-Up](power-ups) in \"Quake\" quadruples the damage caused by the player's weapons for a limited amount of time."

            "The possibilities regarding where the [Producers](producers) of the [Power-Ups](power-ups) are and when [Power-Ups](power-ups) appear are similar to those of [Pick-Ups](pick-ups). The main differences are that [Power-Ups](power-ups) often give the player [New Abilities](new-abilities) or [Privileged Abilities](privileged-abilities), and one has to determine how long the effect of the [Power-Up](power-ups) lasts and if players can [Trading](trading) them. However, [Power-Ups](power-ups) can also provide [Improved Abilities](improved-abilities) such as temporarily raising [Skills](skills).",
            "Since the [Power-Up](power-ups) typically gives the player an advantage without a matching disadvantage, the use of [Power-Ups](power-ups) may cause problems with [Player Balance](player-balance) more easily than using plain [Pick-Ups](pick-ups)."

        "consequences": [
            "[Power-Ups](power-ups) share many of the consequences of [Pick-Ups](pick-ups) but typically have a more transient effect. Since the effect has a [Time Limit](time-limits), picking up a [Power-Up](power-ups) can actually increase [Tension](tension) if the usefulness of the [Power-Up](power-ups) depends on the success of other goals, for example, using the quad damage [Power-Up](power-ups) properly in \"Quake\" games efficiently depends on locating and hitting enemies first. [Power-Ups](power-ups) can be used as target objects for [Gain Competence](gain-competence) goals.",
            "[Power-Ups](power-ups) give players [Ephemeral Goals](ephemeral-goals) of [Collecting](collecting) when they appear; knowing their location and when they are produced allows players to locate [Strategic Locations](strategic-locations) and have [Strategic Knowledge](strategic-knowledge)."
