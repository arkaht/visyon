        "description": [
            "[Focus Loci,](focus-loci) the locations of thefocus, are the game elements through which players can affect the game state. The most obvious [Focus Loci](focus-loci) are the game elements that can be moved by the player, and the actions they provide are the possibility of moving them."
        ],
        "examples": [
            "Each piece in \"Chess\" acts as a [Focus Loci](focus-loci) for the players by providing a number of potential actions.",
            "The stones used in \"Go\" are only [Focus Loci](focus-loci) when they are being placed on the board, since players cannot perform any other actions through them later.",
            "The [Avatar](avatars) that a player controls in a first-person shooter is the [Focus Loci](focus-loci) they have in the game.",
            "Various types of mouse cursors used in real-time strategy games and \"Sims\" games are [Focus Loci](focus-loci) that allow players to move between units and characters, which in their turn are also [Focus Loci](focus-loci)."
        ],
        "usage": [
            "The four main options for [Focus Loci](focus-loci) are [Avatar](avatars), [Units](units), [Characters](characters), and [God's Fingers](god-finger). The first three can maintain a [Consistent Reality Logic](consistent-reality-logic), but the actions they provide are then restricted by the [Alternative Reality](alternative-reality) of the game. They also allow points within the game for players to have [Identification](identification) with. The use of [Characters](characters) allows players to have [Focus Loci](focus-loci) without the need for [Game Worlds](game-world). The use of several [Focus Loci](focus-loci) through [Units](units) allows single players to simulate [Team Play](team-play) but requires [Attention Swapping](attention-swapping) and [Status Indicators](status-indicators) to show where the [Focus Loci](focus-loci) are in the [Game World](game-world). As the swapping between [Units](units) is often done by explicit actions performed from a [Third-Person View](third-person-views), this [Third-Person View](third-person-views) can actually be seen as a form of [Focus Loci](focus-loci). [God's Fingers](god-finger) are most often used to allow players to have [Game State Overview](game-state-overview) and to let them do [Attention Swapping](attention-swapping) between other [Focus Loci](focus-loci) but can be used to provide the god-like actions found in god games.",
            "Although not as common as the three main options, [Cards](cards) can, especially in collectable card games, be [Focus Loci](focus-loci) either when being played or by being in play and giving a player [New Abilities](new-abilities). [Book-Keeping Tokens](book-keeping-tokens) whose presences indicate that a player has [New Abilities](new-abilities) are another form of more unusual [Focus Loci](focus-loci). [Dice](dice) are seldom [Focus Loci](focus-loci) except in pure dice games, since using them is not usually an activity affecting the game directly but rather determining how actions are to be performed.",
            "The choice of [Focus Loci](focus-loci) and the actions they support dictate which game elements players have [Indirect Control](indirect-control) over."

        "consequences": [
            "[Focus Loci](focus-loci) are game elements within [Game Worlds](game-world) thatprovide methods for players to affect the [Game Worlds](game-world). [Focus Loci](focus-loci) can affect the [Game World](game-world) usually by affecting themselves, other game elements, or the environment in their immediate vicinity, for example, to gain [Area Control](area-control) in the latter case. These [Focus Loci](focus-loci) support [Cognitive Immersion,](cognitive-immersion) and in some cases, [Spatial Immersion](spatial-immersion). The [Focus Loci](focus-loci) that are not defined as part of the [Game World](game-world) primarily support [Cognitive Immersion](cognitive-immersion) but can also support [Sensory-Motoric Immersion](sensory-motoric-immersion).",
            "Providing multiple [Focus Loci](focus-loci) affects the [Risk/Reward](risk-reward) tradeoffs that have to be made when initiating [Extended Actions](extended-actions)."
