        "definition": "The feeling of caring about the outcome of actions or events in a game without having full control over them.",
        "description": [
            "[Tension](tension) occurs in games that have uncertain outcomes, when players have emotional investments in which of these outcomes occurs but cannot fully control them. [Tension](tension) can be either due to several sorts of interest in the outcome for players: if they are trying to make one of the outcomes occur; if the outcome has an affect of characters in the game that the players care for; or if the outcome has real-world effects."
        ],
        "examples": [
            "Having placed most of one's markers in a bet in \"Poker\" is a classical case where players can feel tension.",
            "The dark and claustrophobic environments in the \"Doom\" games easily cause [Tension](tension) as players guide their [Avatars](avatars) through rooms and corridors, expecting monsters to appear."
        ],
        "usage": [
            "The presence of [Deadly Traps](deadly-traps), [Player Killing](player-killing),[Player Elimination](player-elimination), and [Enemies](enemies) with [Overcome](overcome) goals guarantees the existence of forces that are trying to inflict [Penalties](penalties) or [Damage](damage) on players, so these can be used to create [Tension](tension). This can be further modulated by using [Near Miss Indicators](near-miss-indicators), by making the [Enemies](enemies) more powerful over time, as [Boss Monsters](boss-monsters) are examples of, or by making [Tied Results](tied-results) impossible through [Tiebreakers](tiebreakers). The threat of [Early Elimination](early-elimination) is a concrete way to raise [Tension](tension). [Competition](competition) and [Conflict](conflict) between players also creates [Tension](tension), often more than by the presence of [Enemies](enemies). This [Tension](tension) between the players can be modulated with [Balancing Effects](balancing-effects). When the ways to overcomethe [Enemies](enemies) orother players depend on [Paper-Rock-Scissors](paper-rock-scissors) relations, the [Tension](tension) can be further increased since players may choose ineffective methods. [Consumers](consumers) with no positive effects that automatically consume players' [Resources](resources) provide similar [Tension](tension) to players as [Enemies](enemies) and opposing players.",
            "[Narrative Structures](narrative-structures) can create [Tension](tension) in games in the same ways as in other narrative mediums, and can be modulated by [Clues](clues) or [Red Herrings](red-herrings), but can also do so in games through modulating players' [Perceived Chance to Succeed](perceived-chanceto-succeed), typically by giving players an [Uncertainty of Information](uncertaintyof-information). However, when narratives do not contain [Tension](tension), or when the unfolding of them causes players to have [Downtime](downtime), players are likely to lose any feeling of [Tension](tension). [Game Masters](game-masters) can notice these occurrences and adjust the [Narrative Structure](narrative-structures) or interaction accordingly.",
            "Putting [Time Limits](time-limits) on how long players have to try and succeed with actions is an effective way to create [Tension](tension). This can be done as an explicit [Time Limit](time-limits) or be achieved implicitly through [The Show Must Go On](the-show-must-go-on). The [Tension](tension) can then be further increased by requiring [Attention Swapping](attention-swapping).",
            "Another way to modulate the [Tension](tension) is by restricting players' powers or freedom, for example, by [Shrinking Game Worlds](shrinking-game-world),[Limited Set of Actions](limited-setof-actions), or [Movement Limitations](movement-limitations). The[Tension](tension) caused by dangerous opponents or objects in the [Game World](game-world) can be modulated by setting the [Right Level of Difficulty](right-levelof-difficulty) and can be made to be present before the threats themselves when [Traces](traces) are used.",
            "Forcing players to make commitments and then not letting them affect the outcome, or at least limit how they can affect the outcome, can create [Tension](tension). [Betting](betting) and [Stealth](stealth) are similar in that they are activities that require [Turn Taking](turn-taking), [Downtime](downtime), and [No-Ops](no-ops) can create [Tension](tension), and both are usually combined with [Randomness](randomness), [Tradeoffs](tradeoffs), [Risk/Reward](risk-reward) choices, and the possibility to feel [Luck](luck). [Geometric Rewards for Investments](geometric-rewardsfor-investments) can create this form of [Tension](tension) as the invested [Resources](resources) are bound, and failed investments cause not only the already invested resources to be lost but lessen the value of [Resources](resources) that have not yet been invested. This form of [Tension](tension) can be further modulated through the presence of [Progress Indicators](progress-indicators) and [Status Indicators](status-indicators) but can be ruined by [Perfect Information](perfect-information) about the evaluation function and all the game state values that affect the function. However, [Tension](tension) can be lost instead of created if the players lose a [Perceived Chance to Succeed](perceived-chanceto-succeed) because of necessary [Leaps of Faith](leapsof-faith), extended [Downtime](downtime), or [Turn Taking](turn-taking).",
            "Many activities and goals in games combine several of these aspects, for example, [Combat](combat) or [Aim & Shoot](aim-shoot) activities give players opponents and threaten to take players' [Lives](lives). [Continuous Goals](continuous-goals) and [Extended Actions](extended-actions) with[Delayed Effects](delayed-effects) can combine the risk of losing ongoing [Rewards](rewards) with the threats of [Penalties](penalties), for example, through [King of the Hill](kingofthe-hill) or [Evade](evade) goals and in [Quick Games](quick-games).",
            "Many aspects of [Cooperation](cooperation) and [Social Interaction](social-interaction) where players have to rely on other players' actions give rise to [Tension](tension). Any interaction where [Uncertainty of Information](uncertaintyof-information) or possibility for disinformationexists due to player communication can generate [Tension,](tension) but it is especially likely to occur with [Delayed Reciprocity](delayed-reciprocity) or when [Betrayal](betrayal) and [Bluffing](bluffing) is possible. Examples when [Tension](tension) can be created in this fashion include [Player-Decided Distribution of Rewards & Penalties](player-decided-distributionof-rewards-penalties) and the presence of [Shared Resources](shared-resources). [Tension](tension) related to [Social Interaction](social-interaction) exists in many cases for both the ones that can lose from the actions and the ones that can gain, as is typical in [Social Dilemmas](social-dilemmas).",
            "[Reversability](reversability) and the possibility to recreate previous game states through [Save-Load Cycles](save-load-cycles) lessens [Tension](tension), as players can replay moments that contained [Tension](tension) and the feeling is less likely to be as strong on subsequent exposures. Therefore, [Tension](tension) does not usually work together with general [Experimenting](experimenting), although they can do so when the experimentation is motivated by [Player Defined Goals](player-defined-goals)."
        ],
        "consequences": [
            "[Tension](tension) is one of the more direct ways game can be designed to have [Emotional Immersion](emotional-immersion). [Tension](tension) can be caused by putting players in the position of missing [Rewards](rewards) or in the position of receiving [Penalties](penalties), which either affect themselves or something with which they have [Identification](identification). Especially [Competition](competition) and questions of [Ownership](ownership) can evoke [Tension](tension), in the latter case either because players have [Gain Ownership](gain-ownership) goals or because opponents want to take away [Ownership](ownership) of something from players. [Anticipation](anticipation) is a way to modulate [Tension](tension), the more [Anticipation](anticipation) players feel, the more [Tension](tension) they will also likely feel. Feeling forced to perform actions within a certain [Time Limit](time-limits), for example in [The Show Must Go On](the-show-must-go-on), can in some cases be a reason for [Tension](tension) to occur. [Game Pauses](game-pauses) in general have an effect on levels of [Tension](tension).",
            "[Tension](tension) can spill from games into the real world as [Extra-Game Consequences](extra-game-consequences), and the risk for this happening increase with the presence, as especially combinations of, extra-game rewards, [Social Interaction](social-interaction), and questions of [Ownership](ownership).",
            "Repeated exposure to the same form of events or actions decreases the [Tension](tension) they cause, so [Replayability](replayability) and [Tension](tension) is difficult to combine, especially if the [Tension](tension) is caused by [Narrative Structures](narrative-structures) or other effects that rely on players not knowing what will occur. This problem of repeated exposure can partly be mitigated by [Higher-Level Closures as Gameplay Progresses](higher-level-closuresas-gameplay-progresses), as for example, naturally occurs in [Tournaments](tournaments) or can be explicitly designed through [Boss Monsters](boss-monsters) or [Narrative Structures](narrative-structures)."
