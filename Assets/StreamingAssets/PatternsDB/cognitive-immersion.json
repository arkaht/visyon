        "definition": "Having ones attention focused upon problem-solving aspects of a game.",
        "description": [
            "Many games offer players many possible actions and the possibility to plan several actions ahead. By doing so they let players regard the game as a problem-solving activity and thereby have [Cognitive Immersion](cognitive-immersion) in the game.",
            "Although the processes in the human brain regarding emotions and spatial thinking are parts of what are classified as cognitive processes, the meaning of [Cognitive Immersion](cognitive-immersion) is limited to that of abstract logical reasoning, as the spatial and emotional immersion has specific meaning regarding gameplay."
        ],
        "examples": [
            "\"Chess\" and \"Go\" are examples of traditional board games that require [Cognitive Immersion](cognitive-immersion) for skillful play.",
            "laying puzzles can be seen as a game where the [Cognitive Immersion](cognitive-immersion) is completely externalized by the rearrangement of pieces players make while completing the puzzle."
        ],
        "usage": [
            "The basic requirement for [Cognitive Immersion](cognitive-immersion) is that players have a [Freedom of Choice](freedomof-choice) between actions and need to consider what action to perform. [Cognitive Immersion](cognitive-immersion) can be encouraged by having action and activities requiring abstract reasoning while actions or events disrupting players' attentions make [Cognitive Immersion](cognitive-immersion) difficult to maintain. However, [Cognitive Immersion](cognitive-immersion) depends heavily on providing the [Right Level of Complexity](right-levelof-complexity): too little complexity makes the reasoning about actions trivial while too much complexity can lead to [Analysis Paralysis](analysis-paralysis) or [Downtime](downtime) for other players. The level of complexity in games can be increased while still providing [Cognitive Immersion](cognitive-immersion) through the use of [Book-Keeping Tokens](book-keeping-tokens) or other forms of [Game State Overviews](game-state-overview). Providing a [Consistent Reality Logic](consistent-reality-logic) can be used to modulate the [Right Level of Complexity](right-levelof-complexity) by removing the need to have to deal with special cases within a complex environment.",
            "Examples of actions that require [Tradeoffs](tradeoffs) and [Risk/Reward](risk-reward) choices and thereby promote [Cognitive Immersion](cognitive-immersion) include [Game World Navigation](game-world-navigation) and [Resource Management](resource-management), especially the use of [Budgeted Action Points](budgeted-action-points) or having to choose how to do [Attention Swapping](attention-swapping) between [Focus Loci](focus-loci). [Memorizing](memorizing) is helped by [Cognitive Immersion](cognitive-immersion) but does not rely upon [Tradeoffs](tradeoffs) and [Risk/Reward](risk-reward) choices, while [Constructive Play](constructive-play) typically encourage [Cognitive Immersion](cognitive-immersion) simply because it encourages planning. [Experimenting](experimenting) and [Puzzle Solving](puzzle-solving) allow [Cognitive Immersion](cognitive-immersion) as activities in the game rather than as planning activities. [Disruption of Focused Attention](disruptionof-focused-attention) events, [Surprises](surprises), and forced [Attention Swapping](attention-swapping) between [Focus Loci](focus-loci) are all examples of how [Cognitive Immersion](cognitive-immersion) can be negatively affected.",
            "[Emotional Immersion](emotional-immersion) and [Cognitive Immersion](cognitive-immersion) affect each other negatively: one is difficult to achieve when one has the other, and the game events that are used to promote one usually makes one lose the other form of [Immersion](immersion)."
        ],
        "consequences": [
            "[Cognitive Immersion](cognitive-immersion) is the [Immersion](immersion) in abstract reasoning about actions, events, and goals in games while playing the game. Being able to reason about these properties of the game does not require [Perfect Information](perfect-information) about them but the game need to have [Predictable Consequences](predictable-consequences). Having both [Predictable Consequences](predictable-consequences) and [Cognitive Immersion](cognitive-immersion) allows player [Anticipation](anticipation) to emerge but also gives rise to [Analysis Paralysis](analysis-paralysis). Games with clearly [Predictable Consequences](predictable-consequences) and game states that are sufficiently easy to generalize can even promote [Cognitive Immersion](cognitive-immersion) and [Stimulated Planning](stimulated-planning) as [Extra-Game Actions](extra-game-actions) between game sessions. Games allowing this form of [Cognitive Immersion](cognitive-immersion) automatically have a level of [Replayability](replayability) since players may want to test their plans and strategies."
