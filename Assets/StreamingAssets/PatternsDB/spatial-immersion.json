        "definition": "Perceiving movement in the game from the perspective of oneself moving.",
        "description": [
            "Real-time games which involve moving a game element in a game world, are easier to perform actions in, if one as a player regards the movement of the game element as one was the game element. This [Spatial Immersion](spatial-immersion) does not require any other identification with the game element and simply makes the cognitive processes easier for the player."
        ],
        "examples": [
            "racing games such as \"Mario Kart: Double Dash!!\" or \"Wipeout\" put the players in the positions of vehicles moving around racing tracks with the goals of avoid obstacles and being the quickest around the track.",
            "first-person shooters easily give players [Spatial Immersion](spatial-immersion) due to the first-person view the games use and the freedom of movement and view they provide."
        ],
        "usage": [
            "[Spatial Immersion](spatial-immersion) is most easily achieved by requiring [Maneuvering](maneuvering) of [Avatars](avatars) in [Real-Time Games](real-time-games) using [First-Person Views](first-person-views). However, [Third-Person Views](third-person-views) can also works as can other [Focus Loci](focus-loci) with the exception of [God Views](god-views). Although [Spatial Immersion](spatial-immersion) is most common in [Real-Time Games,](real-time-games) even [Turn-Based Games](turn-based-games) such as \"RoboRally\" can give [Spatial Immersion](spatial-immersion) by requiring players to plan their [Movement](movement) in advance.",
            "The use of [Cameras](cameras) can increase the [Spatial Immersion](spatial-immersion) but at the cost of limiting the possibilities for [Emotional Immersion](emotional-immersion). [Attention Swapping](attention-swapping) caused by [Surprises](surprises) and other \"Disruption of Focus Attention\" events within the [Game World](game-world) can further strengthen [Spatial Immersion](spatial-immersion). [Aim & Shoot](aim-shoot) and other [Dexterity-Based Actions](dexterity-based-actions) can encourage [Spatial Immersion](spatial-immersion) as they force players to consider the spatial properties of other game elements without necessarily requiring thought about the movement of oneself."
        ],
        "consequences": [
            "[Spatial Immersion](spatial-immersion) is the [Immersion](immersion) gained by perceiving [Maneuvering](maneuvering) of objects in the game from the perspective of oneself moving. Having [Spatial Immersion](spatial-immersion) eases the understanding of where game elements are in the [Game World](game-world) and the consequences of their [Movement](movement), as well as how game elements are spatially related to each other. [Game World Navigation](game-world-navigation) is a common task when performing [Maneuvering,](maneuvering) a task eased by achieving [Spatial Immersion,](spatial-immersion) and gives players the [Anticipation](anticipation) of being able to arrive at a destination. However, [Game World Navigation](game-world-navigation) requires players to form abstract representations of the [Game World](game-world) from an outside perspective and therefore counters [Spatial Immersion](spatial-immersion). This paradoxical effect of navigating can be lessened by giving players [Limited Planning Abilities](limited-planning-ability) so that they are forced to base most of their actions on their immediate surroundings."
