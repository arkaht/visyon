            "All game elements that appear in a gamehave a first initial location, their [Spawn Point](spawn-points). The [Spawn Points](spawn-points) are most noticeable in multi-player games since their effect is most apparent to the players already in the game."

        "examples": [
            "[Spawn Points](spawn-points) are explicitly used in both single player and multiplayer first-person shooters such as \"Quake\" and \"Return to Castle Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory\".",
            "the classic arcade game \"Gauntlet\" has [Spawn Points](spawn-points), which will pour out monsters until the players destroy the monster generators.",
            "many roleplaying games and massively multiplayer online games use [Spawn Points](spawn-points) for the player [Avatars](avatars) but also have spawn points for [Enemies](enemies).",
            "\"Battlefield Vietnam\" offers some novel variations in S\"pawn Points\": vehicles that can be steered around the game area and tunnel exits that can be created by player actions."

        "usage": [
            "Almost all games that use [Spawning](spawning) in [Game Worlds](game-world) or [Levels](levels) make use of [Spawn Points](spawn-points). The main design choice to be made about [Spawn Points](spawn-points) is where to locate them. The suitable locations are usually restricted by a number of factors: what is being spawned, what is the intended [Right Level of Difficulty](right-levelof-difficulty), and what should be chance for [Surprises](surprises) be. It may be of consequences whether the game uses [Lives](lives), and how many [Lives](lives) a player has left, when determining what [Spawn Point](spawn-points) will be used. Further, the effect of being able to do [Camping](camping) close to [Spawn Points](spawn-points) should be considered when placing [Spawn Points](spawn-points).",
            "Coordinated placement of [Spawn Points](spawn-points) belonging to opposing sides in team-based games can be used as [Balancing Effects](balancing-effects) by placing them in equal relations to other [Strategic Locations](strategic-locations), often by using [Symmetry](symmetry)."
        ],
        "consequences": [
            "[Spawn Points](spawn-points) are a form of [Producers](producers) that define where [Spawning](spawning) occurs in [Game Worlds](game-world). [Spawn Points](spawn-points) are in themselves [Strategic Locations](strategic-locations) as the introduction of new units appears there. They can challenge the [Consistent Reality Logic](consistent-reality-logic) as there may be no real world equivalents for such locations, an exception being [Spawn Points](spawn-points) located near the edge of the [Game World](game-world), which can represent access points to an expanded [Game World](game-world)."
