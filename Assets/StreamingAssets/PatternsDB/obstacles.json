    "name": "Obstacles",
    "texts": {
        "definition": "Obstacles are game elements that hinder the players from taking the shortest route between two places.",
        "description": [
            "Often the [Obstacles](obstacles) can be moved, destroyed, or avoided by specific actions but until this has been done (and it has become possible to do so), the [Obstacles](obstacles) slow or block the players' progress in the game."
        ],
        "examples": [
            "The typical [Obstacles](obstacles) in adventure games are locked doors, which can only be opened with a correct key, for example, the locked doors of \"The Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker\" require keys."
        ],
        "usage": [
            "The choice of an [Obstacle](obstacles) determines how players can bypass it, if at all. [Obstacles](obstacles) that block the way to [Inaccessible Areas](inaccessible-areas) are often also [Controllers](controllers), which support an action to remove the [Obstacle](obstacles) but also require a specific [Resource](resources) or [Tool](tools). [Obstacles](obstacles) can be [Outstanding Features](outstanding-features) when placed alone or given different visual appearance to other [Obstacles](obstacles).",
            "Typically, [Obstacles](obstacles) that do not act as boundaries for [Inaccessible Areas](inaccessible-areas) can be avoided by taking a longer route, even if it is simply walking around a boulder or tree. The [Obstacle](obstacles) may not necessarily block the passage through it, but can make the movement slower or cause damage or deplete [Resources](resources). Note that an [Obstacle](obstacles) can also be a larger area, for example, a chasm or a pit.",
            "Skillful players can often bypass more than one [Obstacle](obstacles) at the same time, and without requiring more [Resources](resources) than needed for an [Obstacle](obstacles) -free course. This expression of [Game Mastery](game-mastery) can be made possible by [Timing](timing), e. g., moving between moving objects, or [Dexterity-Based Actions](dexterity-based-actions), e. g., avoiding stationary objects and other vehicles when driving, depending on the nature of the [Obstacle](obstacles).",
            "[Obstacles](obstacles) are usually not deadly to [Units](units) or [Avatars](avatars), at least not immediately. However, they can cause [Leaps of Faith](leapsof-faith) and can hinder [Aim & Shoot](aim-shoot) actions against threats. See [Deadly Traps](deadly-traps) for these types of game elements."
        ],
        "consequences": [
            "[Obstacles](obstacles) create [Movement Limitations](movement-limitations) in how players can perform [Movement](movement) or [Maneuvering](maneuvering) in [Game Worlds](game-world). Depending on the size of the [Obstacles](obstacles), they can also make [Game World Navigation](game-world-navigation) difficult. By using these features and purposely placing them in special locations in [Game Worlds](game-world) it is possible to use [Obstacles](obstacles) to modulate the [Right Level of Difficulty](right-levelof-difficulty) of [Traverse](traverse) or [Exploration](exploration) goals in [Levels](levels).",
            "The combination of several [Obstacles](obstacles) can create natural boundaries to an [Inaccessible Area](inaccessible-areas), and when used in this fashion, they can support the [Narrative Structure](narrative-structures) of the game. To be able to bypass [Obstacles](obstacles) more easily can be the effect of a [Privileged Ability](privileged-abilities) or an expression of [Game Mastery](game-mastery)."
