            "By synchronizing their activities in games players can often manage to affect game states in ways they would not be able to do individually. These activities are called <style=\"CurrentLink\">Team Combos</style> since they either were coordinated by actual teams or can be perceived by others as if they were working as a team.",

            "Playing survivors in the <style=\"Link\"><link=\"http://virt10.itu.chalmers.se/index.php/Left%204%20Dead%20series\">Left 4 Dead series</link></style> typically require some coordination that can be perceived as <style=\"CurrentLink\">Team Combos</style>, e.g. one player covering another which is healing a third or one player making a ''Tank'' infected follow him or her while the others attack it. However, playing infected against teams of humans requires more coordination to make full use of the special abilities available, e.g. the damaging spit that ''spitters'' can place is easily avoided by a survivor unless he is held in place by an attack from a ''charger'' or ''hunter''.",
            "The various classes in <style=\"Link\"><link=\"http://virt10.itu.chalmers.se/index.php/Team%20Fortress%202\">Team Fortress 2</link></style> are built to support each other, e.g. medics can make another player invulnerable with an ''ÜberCharge'' after some preparation and the duo can then perform tasks otherwise impossible. Besides the gameplay advantages this provides, the game promotes people to try and make these <style=\"CurrentLink\">Team Combos</style> by providing achievements. Examples of such achievement range from one that require rather little coordination, e.g. ''Blast Assist''  awarded if ''ÜberCharging'' a Soldier that kills 5 enemies), to those requiring mass coordination, e.g. ''Group Health'' (deploying ''ÜberCharges'' simultaneously with two other Medics).",
            "In <style=\"Link\"><link=\"http://virt10.itu.chalmers.se/index.php/GURPS\">GURPS</link></style>, characters that all have the perk \"Teamwork\" can form up in combat to gain additional advantages as long as they stay close together.",

            "Designing <style=\"CurrentLink\">Team Combos</style> have similarities to designing <style=\"Link\"><link=\"combos\">Combos</link></style> but for temporary or permanent <style=\"Link\"><link=\"parties\">Parties</link></style> or <style=\"Link\"><link=\"teams\">Teams</link></style> in <style=\"Link\"><link=\"multiplayer-games\">Multiplayer Games</link></style>. A difference between the <style=\"CurrentLink\">Team Combos</style> and ordinary <style=\"Link\"><link=\"combos\">Combos</link></style> is that they are more likely to depend upon <style=\"Link\"><link=\"http://virt10.itu.chalmers.se/index.php/Timing\">Timing</link></style>, simply because the different players involved must coordinate when to act or that the <style=\"Link\"><link=\"combos\">Combo</link></style> simply is the effect of simultaneously performing actions. Another way of making <style=\"CurrentLink\">Team Combos</style> different from ordinary <style=\"Link\"><link=\"combos\">Combos</link></style> is making them impossible for one player to perform due to different players having <style=\"Link\"><link=\"characters\">Characters</link></style> with different <style=\"Link\"><link=\"privileged-abilities\">Privileged Abilities</link></style> or <style=\"Link\"><link=\"skills\">Skills</link></style> through the use of <style=\"Link\"><link=\"orthogonal-differentiation\">Orthogonal Differentiation</link></style> and having the <style=\"Link\"><link=\"combos\">Combos</link></style> depend on their joint actions.",

When <style=\"Link\"><link=\"flanking-routes\">Flanking Routes</link></style> exist as well, keeping opponents occupied while other team members make use of these alternative routes is a archetypical example of a <style=\"CurrentLink\">Team Combo</style>.",
            "Players can be encouraged a bit extra in striving for <style=\"CurrentLink\">Team Combos</style> by assigning specific <style=\"Link\"><link=\"goal-achievements\">Goal Achievements</link></style> to them.",
            "An ersatz for <style=\"CurrentLink\">Team Combos</style> can be achieved in <style=\"Link\"><link=\"single-player-games\">Single-Player Games</link></style> through making it possible to make <style=\"Link\"><link=\"combos\">Combos</link></style> using <style=\"Link\"><link=\"units\">Units</link></style> - this since the individual <style=\"Link\"><link=\"units\">Units</link></style> can be seen as being a <style=\"Link\"><link=\"teams\">Team</link></style> cooperating. Another solution for <style=\"Link\"><link=\"single-player-games\">Single-Player Games</link></style> is to provide <style=\"Link\"><link=\"non-player-characters\">Non-Player Characters</link></style> with <style=\"Link\"><link=\"supporting-goals\">Supporting Goals</link></style> that can result in them coordinating themselves with the player to achieve what in effect is a <style=\"CurrentLink\">Team Combo</style>.
