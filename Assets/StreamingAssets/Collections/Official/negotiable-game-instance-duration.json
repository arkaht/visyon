            "Although the rules for <style=\"Link\"><link=\"http://virt10.itu.chalmers.se/index.php/Ricochet%20Robots\">Ricochet Robots</link></style> suggest a number of rounds to play, they also explicitly state that players can change this as long as all players agree upon this before the game starts.",

            "<style=\"CurrentLink\">Negotiable Game Instance Duration</style> can be supported by letting players set <style=\"Link\"><link=\"time-limits\">Time Limits</link></style> for the game instances.

            "<style=\"Link\"><link=\"configurable-gameplay-areas\">Configurable Gameplay Areas</link></style> can also indirectly support this pattern since changing the distances players, <style=\"Link\"><link=\"characters\">Characters</link></style>, or <style=\"Link\"><link=\"units\">Units</link></style> need to move is also likely to change the time it takes to play through the game.",
