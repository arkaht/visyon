While these imbalances may be intentional to fit thematic requirements or are simply difficult to design away, they can be balanced by playing the games several times so each player gets each type of advantage. Such <style=\"CurrentLink\">Back-to-Back Game Sessions</style> may require players to spend more time playing the game to have the intended experience but at the same time can allow different gameplay experiences.",

            "In <style=\"Link\"><link=\"http://virt10.itu.chalmers.se/index.php/Chess\">Chess</link></style> tournaments it is common that players meeting each other play several game instances and that one alternates who starts. This removes the advantage of being the starting player and thereby gives a more balanced result. This can be applied to <style=\"Link\"><link=\"http://virt10.itu.chalmers.se/index.php/Go\">Go</link></style> tournaments as well even if the <i>komi</i> compensation is intended to remove first player advantages.

The game rules suggest that players play each scenario twice, switching sides between each game instance, to make it possible for players to compare how well they played. The scenarios in <style=\"Link\"><link=\"http://virt10.itu.chalmers.se/index.php/Space%20Hulk\">Space Hulk</link></style> are often tilted in the favor of the \"genestealer\" player and for this reason a fair judgment of how players have succeeded is difficult to do without playing scenarios twice with roles reversed after the first game instance.",

            "Designing <style=\"CurrentLink\">Back-to-Back Game Sessions</style> for games where all players are co-located is mainly a question of encouraging players to play the game several times with changes roles.
