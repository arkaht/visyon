            "While most games are easy to note as being games, some games deliberately try to hide their existence, at least to those not playing them. This can cause a problem with recruiting players, especially for those games that are staged professionally and intended to get the general public to participate in them. <style=\"CurrentLink\">Rabbit Hole Invitations</style> is a solution to this which posts cryptic messages in various types of media, and draws those that investigate these into the game.",
