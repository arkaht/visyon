            "Many games have bringing items to specific locations as conditions for gameplay events. While this is in many cases done with both items and locations that are either fictional or virtual, it may also be done with physical ones. The pattern <style=\"CurrentLink\">Artifact-Location Proximity</style> signifies when technology checks whether these types of  condition are met for physical items and locations.",

            "The movement of teams' giant animal totems in <style=\"Link\"><link=\"http://virt10.itu.chalmers.se/index.php/ConQwest\">ConQwest</link></style> is an example of <style=\"CurrentLink\">Artifact-Location Proximity</style>. In the Swedish LARP <style=\"Link\"><link=\"http://virt10.itu.chalmers.se/index.php/Kejsartemplet\">Kejsartemplet</link></style>, the placement of a magic stone in its receptacle removed the power from all wizards; this was implemented through sensing the stone's presence in the receptacle and relaying this electronically to bracelets worn by the wizards.",
            "<style=\"H2\">Using the pattern</style>",
            "Making use of <style=\"CurrentLink\">Artifact-Location Proximity</style> in a game consist of modifying physical <style=\"Link\"><link=\"game-items\">Game Items</link></style> (quite often <style=\"Link\"><link=\"tools\">Tools</link></style>) so that they can be sensed by some technology embedded in a specific location. The modification required depends primarily on the sensing technology used, and the technology choice can also determine what actually is meant by proximity and what artifacts can trigger the proximity. For example, RFID tags can let the game design determine exactly which unique artifacts trigger conditions with a short range while a pressure plate would accept all artifacts over a certain weight placed on it.",
            "<style=\"CurrentLink\">Artifact-Location Proximity</style> can require <style=\"Link\"><link=\"extended-actions\">Extended Actions</link></style> to trigger either the condition of entering or leaving the proximity of a location. This may be to control player actions (not being able to leave with the artifact immediately or having a chance of returning it shortly after it has been removed). It also provides a  safeguard if the sensing technology used is deemed a bit unreliable.",
