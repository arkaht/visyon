            "The board game <style=\"Link\"><link=\"http://virt10.itu.chalmers.se/index.php/Space%20Hulk\">Space Hulk</link></style> provides players with many low-level <style=\"CurrentLink\">Asymmetric Goals</style> by matching slow-moving space marines, which have ranged weapons, against fast-moving aliens, which can only fight in close combat.",

            "<style=\"Link\"><link=\"preventing-goals\">Preventing Goals</link></style> are by definition linked to other goals and since they are not similar this is a way to provide <style=\"CurrentLink\">Asymmetric Goals</style> in a game. Another way it through providing <style=\"Link\"><link=\"http://virt10.itu.chalmers.se/index.php/Role%20Reversal\">Role Reversal</link></style> since switching roles in many cases means having different goals. A third way is in games where several players each have a <style=\"Link\"><link=\"freedom-choice\">Freedom of Choice</link></style> in which goals to pursuit since as long as they don't pick the same goals (if that is possible) the goals will be asymmetric to each other.

            "Given that <style=\"CurrentLink\">Asymmetric Goals</style> often have different requirements, it can be relevant to consider connecting <style=\"Link\"><link=\"http://virt10.itu.chalmers.se/index.php/Asymmetric%20Abilities\">Asymmetric Abilities</link></style> to the goals so players are given <style=\"Link\"><link=\"abilities\">Abilities</link></style> that fit the requirements of the goals. <style=\"Link\"><link=\"http://virt10.itu.chalmers.se/index.php/Paper-Rock-Scissors\">Paper-Rock-Scissors</link></style> can be applied to several <style=\"CurrentLink\">Asymmetric Goals</style> to create loops of goals which are different to each other but which are created so they all have advantages against other goals in the loop. A benefit of this is that this can mitigate problems with <style=\"Link\"><link=\"player-balance\">Player Balance</link></style> while preserving the asymmetry.",
