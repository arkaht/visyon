The time needed to complete the second, evaluation, phase can differ but this is pretty much up to the players and they cannot affect the outcome by varying this.

If one wishes to provide players with <style=\"Link\"><link=\"freedom-choice\">Freedom of Choice</link></style>, a simple modification is to allow the players to set the <style=\"Link\"><link=\"time-limits\">Time Limits</link></style> before gameplay starts.
