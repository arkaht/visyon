            "One of the appeals of games is arguable that players can influence what happens while playing, and feel that they have various possible ways in how exert that influence. However, that influence cannot be to powerful since then reaching any goal in any given game would become too easy and lose whatever potential for appeal it could otherwise have. This line of thought can both be found in the common advice on game design attributed to Sid Meier, “a [good] game is a series of interesting choices,” but also in how definitions of games mention goals, conflicts and uncertainty (e.g. Suit, Salen & Zimmerman, Costikyan, Juul). Typically players' influences are limited through lack of information or skill in executing actions, through active opposition or through randomness in the outcome of actions.",
            "Although it may see strange that designers would like to trick players they may wish to make players believe that the have more influence on the game than they do for two reasons. First, the designers have limited resources and may want the world to feel more open than it actually is by giving the players the illusion that they can explore or interact with more of the diegetic game world than they actually can. Second, the designers may wish to tell a story in a certain way or stage encounters in special ways without making the players realize that they are being guiding into a certain situation.",
            "Some games allow actions that do not actually make players come closer to achieving goals, or even changing the game state. When these actions appear meaningful, including being meaningful to the player but not within a game state perspective, the players have an <style=\"CurrentLink\">Exaggerated Perception of Influence</style> within the game.",
            "<style=\"H3\">Examples</style>",
            "Games with well-developed stories, such as the <style=\"Link\"><link=\"http://virt10.itu.chalmers.se/index.php/Final%20Fantasy%20series\">Final Fantasy</link></style> or <style=\"Link\"><link=\"http://virt10.itu.chalmers.se/index.php/The%20Legend%20of%20Zelda%20series\">The Legend of Zelda series</link></style>, do not let players experience the stories unless they complete the goals. Since these stories are more or less linear the actual effect of players' actions on how the story finally ends is very limited (what the players' do control is if they get to experience it). Even in games where several branches in the story exists (e.g. <style=\"Link\"><link=\"http://virt10.itu.chalmers.se/index.php/Dragon%20Age:%20Origins\">Dragon Age: Origins</link></style> or the <style=\"Link\"><link=\"http://virt10.itu.chalmers.se/index.php/Fallout%20series\">Fallout series</link></style>) the variations have also been created before the game sessions began. This does not mean that players of these types of games do not have any influence: locally the gameplay can give players high levels of influences and on a meta level players can have concrete choices of which achievements to collect and which strategies to try.",
            "In <style=\"Link\"><link=\"http://virt10.itu.chalmers.se/index.php/September%2012th\">September 12th</link></style> players are given the impression that they can free the world of terrorism by killing individual terrorist but learn through gameplay that their own actions create more terrorists. By thus providing players with an <style=\"CurrentLink\">Exaggerated Perception of Influence</style> they unknowingly engage in a futile activity designed to make them reflect on approaches to combating terrorism.",
            "<style=\"H2\">Using the pattern</style>",
            "Given that players' perceptions of influence in a games is a highly subjective issue, designing for this pattern to occur in games is difficult and many solutions can easily backfire if players realize that a certain pattern is used to try and achieve an erroneous opinion of their own importance. In fact, when players no longer become better at playing a game and fully understand their possibilities of influencing the game, it may be impossible to achieve the pattern for those players. Since one way of no being able to improve in a game is to have fully mastered it, <style=\"Link\"><link=\"gameplay-mastery\">Gameplay Mastery</link></style> is typically in conflict with <style=\"CurrentLink\">Exaggerated Perception of Influence</style>. That being said, this pattern can mainly be instantiated in games in two ways. First, through affecting how strongly players can control the gameplay and, second, how many options players have when trying to affect it. These do not have to be strongly related but can of course be combined. In addition to this, players can be given much influence on one level of interaction within the game without being able to change the way the game develops on overall.",
            "Giving players more control over gameplay is primarily done through <style=\"Link\"><link=\"facilitating-rewards\">Facilitating Rewards</link></style> of different sorts. Providing players with <style=\"Link\"><link=\"abilities\">Abilities</link></style> that at least seem relevant to their goals can provide an <style=\"CurrentLink\">Exaggerated Perception of Influence</style> if the players can misjudge how much influence they actually are given. This can further be promoted through <style=\"Link\"><link=\"http://virt10.itu.chalmers.se/index.php/Buffs\">Buffs</link></style>, <style=\"Link\"><link=\"http://virt10.itu.chalmers.se/index.php/Increased%20Abilities\">Increased Abilities</link></style>, <style=\"Link\"><link=\"new-abilities\">New Abilities</link></style>, <style=\"Link\"><link=\"tools\">Tools</link></style>, or access to <style=\"Link\"><link=\"controllers\">Controllers</link></style> regardless of how large the gameplay benefit is or if these are <style=\"Link\"><link=\"temporary-abilities\">Temporary Abilities</link></style>; this simply because the mentioned patterns cause a change in the level of influence the players have (this may be especially true in games with <style=\"Link\"><link=\"http://virt10.itu.chalmers.se/index.php/Red%20Queen%20Dilemmas\">Red Queen Dilemmas</link></style>). <style=\"Link\"><link=\"skills\">Skills</link></style> are not as effective as the suggestions just given since <style=\"Link\"><link=\"skills\">Skills</link></style> often state how likely success are in some form or another; <style=\"Link\"><link=\"skills\">Skill</link></style> tests that are determined completely deterministically can even work against the pattern. <style=\"Link\"><link=\"balancing-effects\">Balancing Effects</link></style> can give players <style=\"CurrentLink\">Exaggerated Perception of Influence</style> simply because the games provide help to them, but this may backfire if clearly detected by the players and then lead to a lost perception of influence instead.Similarly, <style=\"Link\"><link=\"player-augmentations\">Player Augmentations</link></style> (such as <style=\"Link\"><link=\"auto-aim\">Auto-Aim</link></style>) can both make players have or lose <style=\"CurrentLink\">Exaggerated Perception of Influence</style> depending on how they perceive their own agency in the game.",
            "For providing control over gameplay, letting players have a <style=\"Link\"><link=\"determinable-chance-succeed\">Determinable Chance to Succeed</link></style> can be a basis for <style=\"CurrentLink\">Exaggerated Perception of Influence</style>. Even if this may seem paradoxical since they know exactly how big chance they have to complete some action or goal, the figure shown to them may not be the actual chance succeeding. For the chance of single actions, <style=\"Link\"><link=\"interruptible-actions\">Interruptible Actions</link></style> may add extra uncertainty and thereby make the figure not accurate of the real chance of success. For goals that require many actions the chances shown may not take into considerations of actions taken by <style=\"Link\"><link=\"enemies\">Enemies</link></style> or other players in <style=\"Link\"><link=\"multiplayer-games\">Multiplayer Games</link></style>, and simply adding up the probabilities may skew players' expectations to be too great. <style=\"Link\"><link=\"grinding\">Grinding</link></style> may be another way to achieve the same effect, since even if one has a small chance of succeeding one may believe that one can after many actions reach a goal. <style=\"Link\"><link=\"randomness\">Randomness</link></style> can achieved <style=\"CurrentLink\">Exaggerated Perception of Influence</style> but this is a volatile solution since it depends on players feeling that they have <style=\"Link\"><link=\"luck\">Luck</link></style>, and it they do not the <style=\"Link\"><link=\"randomness\">Randomness</link></style> counters the effect rather than supports it. <style=\"Link\"><link=\"fudged-results\">Fudged Results</link></style> instantiated through <style=\"Link\"><link=\"extra-chances\">Extra Chances</link></style> can compensate for this to a certain degree. This perception is also brittle in the sense that players with <style=\"Link\"><link=\"strategic-knowledge\">Strategic Knowledge</link></style> about the <style=\"Link\"><link=\"randomness\">Randomness</link></style> or about the statistics involved will not have the perception (even with the presence of <style=\"Link\"><link=\"extra-chances\">Extra Chances</link></style>), and for games with <style=\"Link\"><link=\"replayability\">Replayability</link></style> many players may achieve this form of <style=\"Link\"><link=\"gameplay-mastery\">Gameplay Mastery</link></style>. Even so this is one of the few ways to support <style=\"Link\"><link=\"no-direct-player-influence\">No Direct Player Influence</link></style>.",
            "Presenting many options to players is quite easily done with <style=\"Link\"><link=\"freedom-choice\">Freedom of Choice</link></style>. It is a usually an requirement for <style=\"CurrentLink\">Exaggerated Perception of Influence</style> since even if the players' actions could affect the game world in significant ways the players' contribution is diminished if there was no other choice. However, it is not always necessary. Games that test players' skills in performing certain tasks through <style=\"Link\"><link=\"dexterity-based-actions\">Dexterity-Based Actions</link></style>, e.g. <style=\"Link\"><link=\"http://virt10.itu.chalmers.se/index.php/Timing\">Timing</link></style>, <style=\"Link\"><link=\"aim-shoot\">Aim & Shoot</link></style>, <style=\"Link\"><link=\"maneuvering\">Maneuvering</link></style>, let players have a possibility to influence the outcome of the gameplay even if there is only one option of what should be done. For <style=\"Link\"><link=\"aim-shoot\">Aim & Shoot</link></style>, this can be augmented through <style=\"Link\"><link=\"auto-aim\">Auto-Aim</link></style> functionality which can make players perform better without them being able to notice if it is due to themselves or the game system.

This can especially be the case when <style=\"Link\"><link=\"http://virt10.itu.chalmers.se/index.php/Imperfect%20Information\">Imperfect Information</link></style> in used in combination with <style=\"Link\"><link=\"end-state-scoring\">End State Scoring</link></style>, but the latter pattern can provide <style=\"CurrentLink\">Exaggerated Perception of Influence</style> on its own if it too complex for players to calculate every players positions before the game actually ends.

The ability of other people that those playing the game, e.g. through <style=\"Link\"><link=\"non-player-help\">Non-Player Help</link></style>, can also work against the pattern since it lowers the overall influence the players themselves have on the outcome of the game.",
            "<style=\"CurrentLink\">Exaggerated Perception of Influence</style> can be difficult on a global level to maintain in <style=\"Link\"><link=\"unwinnable-games\">Unwinnable Games</link></style>, or those with <style=\"Link\"><link=\"drop-in-drop-out\">Drop-In/Drop-Out</link></style> or enforced <style=\"Link\"><link=\"no-ops\">No-Ops</link></style>.

To achieve its' presence in these cases, one instead has to focus on giving players' too strong impressions of their own influence on a local level. One way to achieve this is through <style=\"Link\"><link=\"http://virt10.itu.chalmers.se/index.php/Smooth%20Learning%20Curves\">Smooth Learning Curves</link></style>, since these can let players have a good chance of success initially and maintain that by slowly increasing the difficulty.
