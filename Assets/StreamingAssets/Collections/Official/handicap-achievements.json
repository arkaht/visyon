            "Players who have mastered a specific game, or are so familiar with a game genre that they wish to have an increased challenge from the start of a game, typically need higher levels of difficulty in the gameplay to be able to enjoy the game. Game designers may feel a need to reward these players differently, so that they can feel that the extra skills and efforts they put into such gameplay is acknowledged. While achievements in general are persistent ways of recognizing what players have done in games, <style=\"CurrentLink\">Handicap Achievements</style> provides a means to reward players for completing a game, or a part of a game, in a more complex or difficult way than is normally required.",

            "Games with achievement systems and different difficulty settings typically provide different achievements for each of these settings. <style=\"Link\"><link=\"http://virt10.itu.chalmers.se/index.php/Fallout:%20New%20Vegas\">Fallout: New Vegas</link></style> of the <style=\"Link\"><link=\"http://virt10.itu.chalmers.se/index.php/Fallout%20series\">Fallout series</link></style> provides the <i>Hardcore</i> achievement for completing the entire game in the mode with the same name where players need to replenish food, water, and sleep regularly.

            "In a similar vein, <style=\"Link\"><link=\"http://virt10.itu.chalmers.se/index.php/Left%204%20Dead%202\">Left 4 Dead 2</link></style> provides the <i>Still Something to Prove</i> for completing all campaigns on expert difficulty, and <i>The Real Deal</i> for completing any campaign on expert with the added difficulty of the Realism mode (which makes it more difficult to see where items and other players are).",
            "The action RPG <style=\"Link\"><link=\"http://virt10.itu.chalmers.se/index.php/Torchlight\">Torchlight</link></style> provide <i>Beast Slayer II</i> and <i>Beast Slayer III</i> for those players that complete the game on hard or very hard levels instead of the easy or normal levels (which gives <i>Beast Slayer I</i>). Further, <style=\"Link\"><link=\"http://virt10.itu.chalmers.se/index.php/Torchlight\">Torchlight</link></style> has a hardcore mode that does not allow respawning (so one cannot die without ending the game) and gives the achievements <i>Hardcore Victor</i>, <i>Hardcore Hero</i>, <i>Hardcore Champion</i>, or <i>Hardcore God</i> depending on whether one played on easy, normal, hard, or very hard level.

            "Putting time limits can also provide a means of creating <style=\"CurrentLink\">Handicap Achievements</style>. <style=\"Link\"><link=\"http://virt10.itu.chalmers.se/index.php/Torchlight\">Torchlight</link></style> does this through the two achievements <i>Swift Execution</i> and <i>Speed King</i> with requires that the main enemy, Ordrak, is defeated in less than 5 and 8 hours respectively.

            "Some games provide <style=\"CurrentLink\">Handicap Achievements</style> to players that complete levels, quests, or the entire game without using certain features of the game since these make the game easier. For example, the <i>Akimbo Assassin</i> achievement in <style=\"Link\"><link=\"http://virt10.itu.chalmers.se/index.php/Left%204%20Dead\">Left 4 Dead</link></style> of the <style=\"Link\"><link=\"http://virt10.itu.chalmers.se/index.php/Left%204%20Dead%20series\">Left 4 Dead series</link></style> is awarded for surviving a complete campaign using only pistols and <style=\"Link\"><link=\"http://virt10.itu.chalmers.se/index.php/Left%204%20Dead%202\">Left 4 Dead 2</link></style> provides a similar achievement, <i>Confederacy of Crunches</i> for doing so using only melee weapons.

More specifically though, <style=\"CurrentLink\">Handicap Achievements</style> can be created through considering <style=\"Link\"><link=\"optional-goals\">Optional</link></style> or <style=\"Link\"><link=\"http://virt10.itu.chalmers.se/index.php/Enforced%20Goals\">Enforced Goals</link></style> in a game and then adding some required limitation on how the player can behave. The <style=\"Link\"><link=\"http://virt10.itu.chalmers.se/index.php/Left%204%20Dead%20series\">Left 4 Dead series</link></style> does this in <i>Akimbo Assassin</i> and <i>Confederacy of Crunches</i> through restricting which weapons can be used in <style=\"Link\"><link=\"combat\">Combat</link></style>. Another way is to make use of <style=\"Link\"><link=\"time-limits\">Time Limits</link></style>, which can be seen as a form of <style=\"Link\"><link=\"speedruns\">Speedruns</link></style> in this context, which are exemplified by <i>Swift Execution</i> and <i>Speed King</i> in <style=\"Link\"><link=\"http://virt10.itu.chalmers.se/index.php/Torchlight\">Torchlight</link></style>, and <i>Bridge over Trebled Slaughter</i> in <style=\"Link\"><link=\"http://virt10.itu.chalmers.se/index.php/Left%204%20Dead%202\">Left 4 Dead 2</link></style>.

            "It should be noted that some <style=\"Link\"><link=\"goal-achievements\">Goal Achievements</link></style> are quite similar to <style=\"CurrentLink\">Handicap Achievements</style>. This is the case for those <style=\"Link\"><link=\"goal-achievements\">Goal Achievements</link></style> which are given for reach with a goal with a clear marginal of success. Although both types make it more difficult to achieve a goal, the goal-based ones do so by requiring better performance rather than increasing the difficulty. Example of these types of <style=\"Link\"><link=\"goal-achievements\">Goal Achievements</link></style> include <i>Perfect Victory</i> in <style=\"Link\"><link=\"http://virt10.itu.chalmers.se/index.php/Torchlight\">Torchlight</link></style> (one's character cannot have died one time when the game is completed) and <i>Wing and a Prayer</i> in <style=\"Link\"><link=\"http://virt10.itu.chalmers.se/index.php/L4D2\">L4D2</link></style> (which is given for making it through a specific part of the game without taking any damage). Even so, since <style=\"CurrentLink\">Handicap Achievements</style> make use of goals as a basis for their design, the design options available for <style=\"Link\"><link=\"goal-achievements\">Goal Achievements</link></style> are nearly always also worth considering.",
            "Looking at ways of providing optional ways of making goals more difficult for oneself, an easy way presents itself to games with <style=\"Link\"><link=\"difficulty-levels\">Difficulty Levels</link></style>: simply  provide separate <style=\"Link\"><link=\"goal-achievements\">Goal Achievements</link></style> for each setting.",

Given that <style=\"CurrentLink\">Handicap Achievements</style> are based on goals they are a type of <style=\"Link\"><link=\"goal-achievements\">Goal Achievements</link></style> but they are arguable more of an <style=\"Link\"><link=\"optional-goals\">Optional Goal</link></style> than other types of <style=\"Link\"><link=\"achievements\">Achievements</link></style> since it is always possible to complete the underlying goal without requirements of the <style=\"CurrentLink\">Handicap Achievements</style>. An alternative view is that <style=\"CurrentLink\">Handicap Achievements</style> are <style=\"Link\"><link=\"optional-rules\">Optional Rules</link></style> adopted by the players but rules that they need to ensure are followed (i.e. that the <style=\"Link\"><link=\"meta-games\">Meta Games</link></style> provided are also a <style=\"Link\"><link=\"self-facilitated-games\">Self-Facilitated Games</link></style>). Like <style=\"Link\"><link=\"goal-achievements\">Goal Achievements</link></style> in general, <style=\"CurrentLink\">Handicap Achievements</style> can support <style=\"Link\"><link=\"http://virt10.itu.chalmers.se/index.php/Game-Based%20Social%20Statuses\">Game-Based Social Statuses</link></style> by letting players show of <style=\"Link\"><link=\"gameplay-mastery\">Gameplay Mastery</link></style>. They can arguably do so even better than <style=\"Link\"><link=\"goal-achievements\">Goal Achievements</link></style> since they are based upon more <style=\"Link\"><link=\"challenging-gameplay\">Challenging Gameplay</link></style> and can further be said to provide opportunities for such gameplay that might not be considered otherwise. By doing so they can also provide a <style=\"Link\"><link=\"value-effort\">Value of Effort</link></style>, which is somewhat paradoxical since the extra effort required is completely voluntary.",
