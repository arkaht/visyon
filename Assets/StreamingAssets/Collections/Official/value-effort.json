However, both players in all these games can also feel a <style=\"CurrentLink\">Value of Effort</style> in developing, testing, and succeeding with strategies and tactics which let them perceive their developing skills in the games. ",
            "Arcade games using high score lists, e.g. <style=\"Link\"><link=\"http://virt10.itu.chalmers.se/index.php/Pac-Man\">Pac-Man</link></style> and <style=\"Link\"><link=\"http://virt10.itu.chalmers.se/index.php/Space%20Invaders\">Space Invaders</link></style>, provide players with a <style=\"CurrentLink\">Value of Effort</style> for especially good gameplay in that other players can see the scores these results in. While also true for the previous games, games with distinctly different levels, e.g. the <style=\"Link\"><link=\"http://virt10.itu.chalmers.se/index.php/Super%20Mario%20Series\">Super Mario Series</link></style> or the earlier instances in the <style=\"Link\"><link=\"http://virt10.itu.chalmers.se/index.php/Quake%20series\">Quake series</link></style> let players feel a <style=\"CurrentLink\">Value of Effort</style> for each level completed. Another common way to provide <style=\"CurrentLink\">Value of Effort</style> is to divide gameplay challenges into quests, like <style=\"Link\"><link=\"http://virt10.itu.chalmers.se/index.php/Category:Roleplaying%20Games\">Roleplaying Games</link></style> such as the <style=\"Link\"><link=\"http://virt10.itu.chalmers.se/index.php/Elder%20Scrolls%20series\">Elder Scrolls series</link></style> and the <style=\"Link\"><link=\"http://virt10.itu.chalmers.se/index.php/Baldur's%20Gate%20series\">Baldur's Gate series</link></style> for example do.

            "Supporting players in being able to feel a <style=\"CurrentLink\">Value of Effort</style> is typically related to providing them with means of performing actions and ways of providing feedback that show that these actions had meaning. ",
            "At the most general level, this typically means providing <style=\"Link\"><link=\"player-agency\">Player Agency</link></style> or <style=\"Link\"><link=\"http://virt10.itu.chalmers.se/index.php/Creative%20Control\">Creative Control</link></style>. Providing an <style=\"Link\"><link=\"endgame\">Endgame</link></style> is also a general design solution for increasing the likelihood that players have a sense of <style=\"CurrentLink\">Value of Effort</style> since in this phase the efforts of players and the overall game state tend to become very clear.",
            "Letting players set up goals allow them to feel a sense of satisfaction when they goals are met. On a general level this means that <style=\"Link\"><link=\"closure-points\">Closure Points</link></style> or <style=\"Link\"><link=\"pottering\">Pottering</link></style> can support <style=\"CurrentLink\">Value of Effort</style> (since players set up their own goals in the latter case) but more narrow or controlled ways include <style=\"Link\"><link=\"abstract-player-construct-development\">Abstract Player Construct Development</link></style> or <style=\"Link\"><link=\"character-development\">Character Development</link></style>. The former can take the form of allowing <style=\"Link\"><link=\"construction\">Construction</link></style> which has a level of permanence through being <style=\"Link\"><link=\"irreversible-events\">Irreversible Events</link></style> or taking place in <style=\"Link\"><link=\"persistent-game-worlds\">Persistent Game Worlds</link></style>, while the latter can take the form of letting players create <style=\"Link\"><link=\"characters\">Characters</link></style> with  <style=\"Link\"><link=\"player-planned-development\">Player-Planned Development</link></style>. <style=\"Link\"><link=\"persistent-game-worlds\">Persistent Game Worlds</link></style> also work for making the consequences related to <style=\"Link\"><link=\"character-development\">Character Development</link></style> or <style=\"Link\"><link=\"player-planned-development\">Player-Planned Development</link></style> more permanent, so this pattern is useful in many ways for supporting <style=\"CurrentLink\">Value of Effort</style>. In contrast, games with <style=\"Link\"><link=\"further-player-improvement-potential\">Further Player Improvement Potential</link></style> allow players to experience a <style=\"CurrentLink\">Value of Effort</style> in getting better at playing the game, and one example of this (which ties into the section on making efforts visible to others below) occurs in games which allow or encourage <style=\"Link\"><link=\"extra-game-broadcasting\">Extra-Game Broadcasting</link></style> of <style=\"Link\"><link=\"speedruns\">Speedruns</link></style>. <style=\"Link\"><link=\"quests\">Quests</link></style> quite typically display a part of the <style=\"CurrentLink\">Value of Effort</style> they provide through the <style=\"Link\"><link=\"rewards\">Rewards</link></style> offered by them, but can provide other parts through being <style=\"Link\"><link=\"closure-points\">Closure Points</link></style> also.",
            "Players can have a <style=\"CurrentLink\">Value of Effort</style> experience not only when they met goals but when they notice that they process in trying to reach those goals make sense or when they have improved them. This means that supporting <style=\"Link\"><link=\"tactical-planning\">Tactical</link></style> and/or <style=\"Link\"><link=\"strategic-planning\">Strategic Planning</link></style> in a game provides players with a venue for experiencing <style=\"CurrentLink\">Value of Effort</style>. Further, knowing that you have mastered the skills or knowledge required to play a game well also can give players a sensation of <style=\"CurrentLink\">Value of Effort</style>, and for this reason games that support the development of <style=\"Link\"><link=\"gameplay-mastery\">Gameplay Mastery</link></style> also support <style=\"CurrentLink\">Value of Effort</style>. <style=\"Link\"><link=\"kingmaker\">Kingmaker</link></style> in contrast works against players feeling <style=\"CurrentLink\">Value of Effort</style>; it robs certain players from the <style=\"CurrentLink\">Value of Effort</style> that would have let them win while letting others win without feeling that a <style=\"CurrentLink\">Value of Effort</style> in that it was their effort that provide a win. Typically the player being the <style=\"Link\"><link=\"kingmaker\">Kingmaker</link></style> also doesn't feel a <style=\"CurrentLink\">Value of Effort</style> since the act of deciding who should win is typically trivial to perform. ",
            "While letting players met goals can support <style=\"CurrentLink\">Value of Effort</style>, strengthening the effects of those efforts can also support the pattern. <style=\"Link\"><link=\"persistent-game-world-changes\">Persistent Game World Changes</link></style> is a general way of doing this by making the consequences of player actions at least not automatically disappear. Another way is to make efforts feed back on themselves through <style=\"Link\"><link=\"geometric-progression\">Geometric Progression</link></style> of the consequences of <style=\"Link\"><link=\"extended-actions\">Extended Actions</link></style> or by letting players set up <style=\"Link\"><link=\"positive-feedback-loops\">Positive Feedback Loops</link></style> building on these progressions. In contrast, <style=\"Link\"><link=\"arithmetic-progression\">Arithmetic Progression</link></style> does not so much in itself create <style=\"CurrentLink\">Value of Effort</style> but makes any such value created by other actions more predictable and less dependent on earlier actions. <style=\"Link\"><link=\"exaggerated-perception-influence\">Exaggerated Perception of Influence</link></style> can also work for strengthening the effects of player efforts, but in these case typically by tricking players. Providing extra effects of efforts, for example through <style=\"Link\"><link=\"unlocking\">Unlocking</link></style> new content or new abilities, is another way of increasing <style=\"CurrentLink\">Value of Effort</style> in a game design.",
            "One way to provide extra value to the effort players have shown is to make this visible to others.

            "<style=\"Link\"><link=\"achievements\">Achievements</link></style> are something that typically can be added to a game design after the core and main gameplay is in place.

",
            "Designing for <style=\"CurrentLink\">Value of Effort</style> in a game is not only about making players effort feel meaningful for them, it is considering how player actions and game events can diminish or destroy those efforts. Therefore, giving players the possibility of feeling a <style=\"CurrentLink\">Value of Effort</style> can often require much thought about what other patterns to avoid or at least use carefully. A prime example is <style=\"Link\"><link=\"setback-penalties\">Setback Penalties</link></style> which quite clearly can remove player effort. Others, for example <style=\"Link\"><link=\"luck\">Luck</link></style> and <style=\"Link\"><link=\"randomness\">Randomness</link></style> can put in question if making an effort is worthwhile. <style=\"Link\"><link=\"balancing-effects\">Balancing Effects</link></style>, <style=\"Link\"><link=\"dynamic-difficulty-adjustment\">Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment</link></style>, and <style=\"Link\"><link=\"fudged-results\">Fudged Results</link></style> can do this also to a lesser degree and may not disturb <style=\"CurrentLink\">Value of Effort</style> if done skillfully. <style=\"Link\"><link=\"non-player-help\">Non-Player Help</link></style>, <style=\"Link\"><link=\"player-augmentations\">Player Augmentations</link></style>, and <style=\"Link\"><link=\"player-character-skill-composites\">Player/Character Skill Composites</link></style> all remove so of the skill needed by players to complete goals or overcome challenges which can reduce the <style=\"CurrentLink\">Value of Effort</style> of doing so; <style=\"Link\"><link=\"grinding\">Grinding</link></style> and <style=\"Link\"><link=\"purchasable-game-advantages\">Purchasable Game Advantages</link></style> can likewise do so by replacing a need for skill with endurance or money. <style=\"Link\"><link=\"backtracking-levels\">Backtracking Levels</link></style> lessens the value of having reached the turnaround point of the <style=\"Link\"><link=\"levels\">Level</link></style> but otherwise does not have to critically affect the <style=\"CurrentLink\">Value of Effort</style> in a game. In contrast, reaching <style=\"Link\"><link=\"unwinnable-game-states\">Unwinnable Game States</link></style> can make players realize or feel that all their previous efforts have been in vain. ",
            "<style=\"Link\"><link=\"multiplayer-games\">Multiplayer Games</link></style> can both remove <style=\"CurrentLink\">Value of Effort</style> for individual players by having other players do the necessary work (typically in games with <style=\"Link\"><link=\"cooperation\">Cooperation</link></style>) or by allowing players to perform actions that goes counter to other players efforts; in the latter case this is especially likely if actions are <style=\"Link\"><link=\"interruptible-actions\">Interruptible Actions</link></style>. <style=\"Link\"><link=\"multiplayer-games\">Multiplayer Games</link></style> that are designed to support <style=\"Link\"><link=\"drop-in-drop-out\">Drop-In/Drop-Out</link></style> gameplay or <style=\"Link\"><link=\"late-arriving-players\">Late Arriving Players</link></style> typically also have issues with <style=\"CurrentLink\">Value of Effort</style> since the design goal described by those patterns typically require solutions that affect how stable or necessary players' efforts are.
