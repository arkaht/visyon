            "Many games put players in situations where results affecting them are depending on randomness. Such games provide <style=\"CurrentLink\">Misfortune Mitigation</style> if they allow players to do actions that specifically counter these results or let them minimize the risk through how they perform the actions or in which order they perform them.",

            "In <style=\"Link\"><link=\"http://virt10.itu.chalmers.se/index.php/Bloodbowl\">Bloodbowl</link></style> players can choose which order to perform the actions of their team members. This supports <style=\"CurrentLink\">Misfortune Mitigation</style> since several types of results cause turns to end and skilful players can perform all safe actions first and then take actions according to their potential risks.

            "There are three main ways of letting players perform <style=\"CurrentLink\">Misfortune Mitigation</style> in a game. One is through providing <style=\"Link\"><link=\"fixed-distributions\">Fixed Distributions</link></style> since then players can have better knowledge of the risks of performing actions as the results occur during gameplay. A second way is through providing them with ways of having <style=\"Link\"><link=\"extra-chances\">Extra Chances</link></style>, i.e. providing players with the chance of getting a better result when misfortune strikes. A third way, only possible when players need to perform many different actions that all have potential for misfortune, is to let players have a <style=\"Link\"><link=\"freedom-choice\">Freedom of Choice</link></style> in which order to perform the actions. Common to all these ways are that they typically do not guarantee avoiding the bad results. While <style=\"Link\"><link=\"extra-chances\">Extra Chances</link></style> is a form of <style=\"Link\"><link=\"fudged-results\">Fudged Results</link></style>, other forms of this pattern (for example <i>Fate Points</i> in <style=\"Link\"><link=\"http://virt10.itu.chalmers.se/index.php/Warhammer%20Fantasy%20Roleplay\">WFRP</link></style>) can guarantee avoidance.",

More indirectly it can cause experiences of <style=\"Link\"><link=\"luck\">Luck</link></style> through letting players feel lucky that they could avoid the misfortune.
