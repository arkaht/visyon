            "The board game <style=\"Link\"><link=\"http://virt10.itu.chalmers.se/index.php/Go\">Go</link></style> is typically played on board 19 times 19 lines but can be played on other sizes. 13 times 13 lines is used for shorter more tactical games and 9 times 9 gameplay areas are used to teach the basics of the game.",
            "Each game instance of <style=\"Link\"><link=\"http://virt10.itu.chalmers.se/index.php/Settlers%20of%20Catan\">Settlers of Catan</link></style> begins by setting up the gameplay areas by placing hexes. This may be done according to a formula or done randomly to create variation.",
            "<style=\"Link\"><link=\"http://virt10.itu.chalmers.se/index.php/Pirates!\">Pirates!</link></style> makes use of radio beacons to locate game islands in a physical environment. By varying the distances of these beacons, different style of gameplay and length of gameplay sessions have been achieved for each game instance.",
            "The game <style=\"Link\"><link=\"http://virt10.itu.chalmers.se/index.php/Can%20You%20See%20Me%20Now?\">Can You See Me Now?</link></style> takes place both in a real world city and on a map representing the same city. Game instances of the game have been set up in several different cities by selecting which part of them to show on the game map.",

The pattern is most typically achieved through <style=\"Link\"><link=\"tiles\">Tiles</link></style> for <style=\"Link\"><link=\"game-worlds\">Game Worlds</link></style> while markers or the specific installation of underlying technological systems do so for <style=\"Link\"><link=\"real-world-gameplay-spaces\">Real World Gameplay Spaces</link></style>.",
            "The pattern is heavily influence by whether a game is a <style=\"Link\"><link=\"self-facilitated-games\">Self-Facilitated Game</link></style> or not since this puts players in charge of the configuration.

            "When applied on <style=\"Link\"><link=\"game-worlds\">Game Worlds</link></style>, <style=\"CurrentLink\">Configurable Gameplay Areas</style> gives <style=\"Link\"><link=\"reconfigurable-game-worlds\">Reconfigurable Game Worlds</link></style>. For <style=\"Link\"><link=\"self-facilitated-games\">Self-Facilitated Games</link></style>, the pattern gives <style=\"Link\"><link=\"social-adaptability\">Social Adaptability</link></style> since players can before gameplay begins modify the set up to fit their perception of how to achieve the most desirable gameplay possible.",
