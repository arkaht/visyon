            "Turn taking is common in board games and some games have rules that allow the turn order to change during gameplay.

Such events are known as <style=\"CurrentLink\">Flip-Flop Events</style>. ",

            "<style=\"CurrentLink\">Flip-Flop Events</style> are primarily the concern of <style=\"Link\"><link=\"http://virt10.itu.chalmers.se/index.php/Category:Board%20Games\">Board Games</link></style>. <style=\"Link\"><link=\"http://virt10.itu.chalmers.se/index.php/Agricola\">Agricola</link></style>, <style=\"Link\"><link=\"http://virt10.itu.chalmers.se/index.php/Caylus\">Caylus</link></style>, <style=\"Link\"><link=\"http://virt10.itu.chalmers.se/index.php/El%20Grande\">El Grande</link></style>, and <style=\"Link\"><link=\"http://virt10.itu.chalmers.se/index.php/Lords%20of%20Waterdeep\">Lords of Waterdeep</link></style> allows players to perform direct actions that make them first players in a round so those in the last place can create <style=\"CurrentLink\">Flip-Flop Events</style>. <style=\"Link\"><link=\"http://virt10.itu.chalmers.se/index.php/Dominant%20Species\">Dominant Species</link></style> is a weak example because players can only change their position in the turn order one step per round, so <style=\"CurrentLink\">Flip-Flop Events</style> are only possible in two-player game instances. <style=\"Link\"><link=\"http://virt10.itu.chalmers.se/index.php/Uno\">Uno</link></style> is also a weak example in that it is possible to play cards in two-player instances which makes the other player lose a turn.

            "The turn order in <style=\"Link\"><link=\"http://virt10.itu.chalmers.se/index.php/History%20of%20the%20World\">History of the World</link></style> is decided by choosing cards which also decides which country one will play. By choosing the right card, a player that is last in one turn can become first in the next one and use this to take advantage that no other player can have attacked the forces from the first round when scoring in the second round.

Since this requires making a move that minimizes the amount of point gathered it is not necessarily good. Further, the possibility of doing so depends heavily on what the other players do and may not be possible at all except in rare circumstances. To add to this, in the case of <style=\"Link\"><link=\"http://virt10.itu.chalmers.se/index.php/Golf\">Golf</link></style> there is little gameplay advantage in creating <style=\"CurrentLink\">Flip-Flop Events</style> since it gives no direct gameplay advantage...",
            "<style=\"H2\">Using the pattern</style>",
            "Providing the possibility of <style=\"CurrentLink\">Flip-Flop Events</style> is mainly a question of using <style=\"Link\"><link=\"varying-turn-orders\">Varying Turn Orders</link></style>. One common design solution that allows this is tying the use of a <style=\"Link\"><link=\"score-tracks\">Score Track</link></style> to the turn order &mdash; as for example <style=\"Link\"><link=\"http://virt10.itu.chalmers.se/index.php/Egizia\">Egizia</link></style> and <style=\"Link\"><link=\"http://virt10.itu.chalmers.se/index.php/Ursuppe\">Ursuppe</link></style> does  &mdash; but the possibility of performing <style=\"CurrentLink\">Flip-Flop Events</style> with this system depends heavily on how other players behave. Similarly, even if many instantiations of <style=\"Link\"><link=\"varying-turn-orders\">Varying Turn Orders</link></style> can allow <style=\"CurrentLink\">Flip-Flop Events</style>, sometimes unintentionally, the pattern only becomes strongly present in a game when players can take actions to cause these events. Actions, often through <style=\"Link\"><link=\"token-placement\">Token Placement</link></style>, that let players claim the position of first player the next round make the pattern have more presence. <style=\"Link\"><link=\"http://virt10.itu.chalmers.se/index.php/Agricola\">Agricola</link></style> and <style=\"Link\"><link=\"http://virt10.itu.chalmers.se/index.php/Lords%20of%20Waterdeep\">Lords of Waterdeep</link></style> are examples of this. As a contrast, <style=\"Link\"><link=\"extra-turns\">Extra Turns</link></style> create <style=\"CurrentLink\">Flip-Flop Events</style> of sorts, but since it is extra turns introduced rather than rearranging of existing turns in a sequence, it can be said to be a weak example of the pattern.",
