            "Games often want to challenge players, and do so continuously until players have either won them or stopped playing. While players can be challenges anew by being given another type of challenge after one has been overcome, it is quite common for games to use a more difficult variation of a previous challenge, not the least to maintain a common type of gameplay and encourage players to develop the skills associated with the challenges. Games that string together series of steadily more difficult challenges this way can be said to have <style=\"CurrentLink\">Ever Increasing Difficulty</style>. This is most true in games that can never be won because they always provide new and more difficult challenges but a weaker form of the pattern hold true for a game with a limited set of challenges but which presents these in order of difficulty to their players.",

However, due to practical reasons concerning programming, the difficulty in these games  flatten out as some point so they are weak examples of the game. ",

This can only be guaranteed in <style=\"Link\"><link=\"unwinnable-games\">Unwinnable Games</link></style> since these can for practical purposes indefinitely increase the difficulty, but a weaker form of the pattern can be found in games that have end conditions but provide <style=\"CurrentLink\">Ever Increasing Difficulty</style> until those conditions are met. This is a weaker form since skillful or experienced players may neither experience <style=\"Link\"><link=\"challenging-gameplay\">Challenging Gameplay</link></style> or <style=\"Link\"><link=\"tension\">Tension</link></style> from them. ",
            "Designing <style=\"CurrentLink\">Ever Increasing Difficulty</style> depends on finding ways of making challenges more and more difficult as gameplay progresses. Generally, this is designing a <style=\"Link\"><link=\"positive-feedback-loops\">Positive Feedback Loops</link></style> where succeeding against a particular challenge makes the next challenge be more difficult. An archetypical examples of this is presenting players with some form of <style=\"Link\"><link=\"enemies\">Enemy</link></style> and when a player defeats that enemy a stronger or more difficult <style=\"Link\"><link=\"enemies\">Enemy</link></style> is presented. A variant of this is using more and more difficult <style=\"Link\"><link=\"waves\">Waves</link></style> of <style=\"Link\"><link=\"enemies\">Enemies</link></style>. An alternative, which does not have to rely on <style=\"Link\"><link=\"combat\">Combat</link></style> or otherwise overcoming <style=\"Link\"><link=\"enemies\">Enemies</link></style>, is to have more and more difficult <style=\"Link\"><link=\"levels\">Levels</link></style>.
