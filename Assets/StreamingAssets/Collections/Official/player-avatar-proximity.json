            "Being close to other players is important in games where players physically enact gameplay action, e.g. <style=\"Link\"><link=\"http://virt10.itu.chalmers.se/index.php/Category:Live%20Action%20Roleplaying%20Games\">Live Action Roleplaying Games</link></style> and <style=\"Link\"><link=\"http://virt10.itu.chalmers.se/index.php/Category:Sports\">Sports</link></style>. Likewise, games the proximity to other avatars is usually important in games that take place in virtual environments, for example <style=\"Link\"><link=\"http://virt10.itu.chalmers.se/index.php/Category:Fighting%20Games\">Fighting Games</link></style>, <style=\"Link\"><link=\"http://virt10.itu.chalmers.se/index.php/Category:FPS%20Games\">FPS Games</link></style>, and <style=\"Link\"><link=\"http://virt10.itu.chalmers.se/index.php/Category:Massively%20Multiplayer%20Online%20Games\">Massively Multiplayer Online Games</link></style>. However, a less common case is when the physical location of one player and the virtual location of another player's avatar are important to gameplay. This <style=\"CurrentLink\">Player-Avatar Proximity</style> feature can only occur in games where players' locations are mapped to virtual environment (or vice versa) but then give players an additional level of complexity of spatial relations.",

Through GPS devices the locations of the first group is positioned on the map and the group can use this to catch the individual players by coming close to their avatars.",

As one example, <style=\"Link\"><link=\"extended-actions\">Extended Actions</link></style> can be used both to require a certain time before the proximity is acknowledged by the game system and the effect of being in the proximity can be an <style=\"Link\"><link=\"extended-actions\">Extended Action</link></style>.",

Given that both players and avatars have possibility to move, the pattern creates <style=\"Link\"><link=\"physical-navigation\">Physical Navigation</link></style> and is likely to create <style=\"Link\"><link=\"orthogonal-differentiation\">Orthogonal Differentiation</link></style> in the form of <style=\"Link\"><link=\"privileged-movement\">Privileged Movement</link></style> since it is unlikely that players and avatars will have the same possibility of moving. These two ways of locomotion is likely to give games additional <style=\"Link\"><link=\"replayability\">Replayability</link></style>, especially if players need to choose <style=\"Link\"><link=\"http://virt10.itu.chalmers.se/index.php/Character%20Classes\">Character Classes</link></style> and these provide only one of the types of locomotion.",
