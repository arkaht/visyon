            "Players can encounter enemies in many games. In some of these games, the game causes large number of such enemies to stage massed attack against the players, and such attacks are called <style=\"CurrentLink\">Waves</style>. Zagal <i>et al.</i> describe the phenomenon as: \"A wave is a group of usually similar enemy entities that must be avoided or destroyed as they approach the player. There is usually a pause, or respite, between waves. One of the defining aspects of the wave is player interaction results in the end of the game (game over). Segmentation with waves is primarily used to increase the tension of the gameplay.\"",
