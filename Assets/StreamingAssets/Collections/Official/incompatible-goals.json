One way of making goals more challenging is to provide goal that are incompatible with each other, either because one player cannot complete all at the same time or because it sets up other players of the game to work against the completion of the goal. Such sets of goals that cannot be completed at the same time are <style=\"CurrentLink\">Incompatible Goals</style>. ",
