            "That there are many players in multiplayer games makes it more difficult for them to have <style=\"CurrentLink\">Negotiable Play Sessions</style>, since leaving the game may disrupt the gameplay for the other players. Turn-based games that do not need computational support, e.g. <style=\"Link\"><link=\"http://virt10.itu.chalmers.se/index.php/Category:Board%20Games\">Board Games</link></style> such as <style=\"Link\"><link=\"http://virt10.itu.chalmers.se/index.php/Chess\">Chess</link></style> and <style=\"Link\"><link=\"http://virt10.itu.chalmers.se/index.php/Go\">Go</link></style>, can easily be split into many play sessions if both players agree, so they can be said to have some support for <style=\"CurrentLink\">Negotiable Play Sessions</style>. When playing through some asynchronous communication means (such as email) the individual play sessions can take place anytime within the boundaries set up for when one needs to report one's next move. The <style=\"Link\"><link=\"http://virt10.itu.chalmers.se/index.php/Left%204%20Dead%20series\">Left 4 Dead series</link></style> shows that also computer-based games can support that individual players can decide how long to game without it disrupting other players.",

            "While <style=\"CurrentLink\">Negotiable Play Sessions</style> implies that individual players can \"negotiate\" with the game on how long a play session can be while still providing meaningful results, the presence of other players complicates this.

            "Finally, <style=\"Link\"><link=\"time-limits\">Time Limits</link></style> support <style=\"CurrentLink\">Negotiable Play Sessions</style> when players set the limits before starting play sessions even if this does not make the negotiable once they have started.",
