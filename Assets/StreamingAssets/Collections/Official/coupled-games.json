            "Most games are designed to not be intentionally affected other things than the players' actions and the inner workings of the games themselves. However, some game have rules for allowing input from other sources and when these other sources are other games, the games become <style=\"CurrentLink\">Coupled Games</style>.",

            "A limited form of <style=\"CurrentLink\">Coupled Games</style> can be found in the pairing of <style=\"Link\"><link=\"http://virt10.itu.chalmers.se/index.php/Metroid%20Prime\">Metroid Prime</link></style> and <style=\"Link\"><link=\"http://virt10.itu.chalmers.se/index.php/Metroid%20Fusion\">Metroid Fusion</link></style>, which was released on the GameBoy Advance and GameCube respectively. Completing one of these games gave a reward in the other if the systems were linked together, in one case providing a new costume for the main character and in the other allowing players to play the first Metroid game.",
            "Players of <style=\"Link\"><link=\"http://virt10.itu.chalmers.se/index.php/Sonic%20Adventure\">Sonic Adventure</link></style> on the SEGA Dreamcast could find Chao creatures. While these could be raised and played with in the main game, they could also be interacted with as a separate game on the <i>Visual Memory Units</i> - interactive memory cards - of the console. These were also used in the Dreamcast version of <style=\"Link\"><link=\"http://virt10.itu.chalmers.se/index.php/Power%20Stone\">Power Stone</link></style> where players could gain advantages through player various small games on the VMUs.",
