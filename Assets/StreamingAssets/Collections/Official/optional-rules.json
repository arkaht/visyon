            "All games consist of a core of rules which identify them as specific games compared to others. However, many games also have a set of associated <style=\"CurrentLink\">Optional Rules</style>. These can be ones that groups of players simply use to make the game better in their view, so-called <i>house rules</i>, regardless of what any <i>official</i> source says. They can also be rules created by game designers that players can choose to use before gameplay begins as options or ones they can start using after buying expansions.",

            "<style=\"Link\"><link=\"http://virt10.itu.chalmers.se/index.php/Category:Tabletop%20Roleplaying%20Games\">Tabletop Roleplaying Games</link></style> can easily be modified by the game masters and players themselves so they have rules that suit their needs and wishes. In addition, many of them include various <style=\"CurrentLink\">Optional Rules</style> that can be added if more options or detailed outcomes are wanted, as one example <style=\"Link\"><link=\"http://virt10.itu.chalmers.se/index.php/GURPS\">GURPS</link></style> provide many <style=\"CurrentLink\">Optional Rules</style> for actions and modifiers in combat situations.  Yet another way to provide <style=\"CurrentLink\">Optional Rules</style> is through additional rule books, e.g. <i>Low-Tech</i>, <i>High-Tech</i>, <i>Ultra-Tech</i>, and <i>Bio-Tech</i> for <style=\"Link\"><link=\"http://virt10.itu.chalmers.se/index.php/GURPS\">GURPS</link></style> and ''Player's Handbook 2<i>, </i>Player's Handbook 3<i>, and the various </i>power'' books for <style=\"Link\"><link=\"http://virt10.itu.chalmers.se/index.php/Dungeons%20&%20Dragons\">Dungeons & Dragons</link></style> (arcane, divine, martial, and primal).",

Besides being optional themselves, expansion to board game often include <style=\"CurrentLink\">Optional Rules</style>. One example of this can be found in the <i>exodus</i> expansion to <style=\"Link\"><link=\"http://virt10.itu.chalmers.se/index.php/Battlestar%20Galactica:%20The%20Board%20Game\">Battlestar Galactica: The Board Game</link></style> which provides the <i>Cylon Fleet</i>, <i>Conflicted Loyalties</i>, and <i>Ionian Nebula</i> options that can either be added individually or be combined depending on how players wish to change the gameplay.",
