However, the first games of chance seem to have come to being from the use of dice and lots as divination methods , i.e. one let the gods decide who should have the ante. For these, it is enough for players to be 'emotionally attached' (as noted by Juul as begin one part of his definition of games) and believing that they are exerting effort to influence the outcome (another of Juul's characteristics of games) however illusionary that latter part may be. Later examples show that another solution it to make players exert effort before the system is activated.",
