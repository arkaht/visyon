            "<style=\"CurrentLink\">Playing to Lose</style> may not be considered gaming since one is not trying to have a better game state position than other players. However, there are many other ways of viewing this stance towards a game. First, <style=\"CurrentLink\">Playing to Lose</style> can be seen as an individual goal that players are try to reach. Second, it can be seen as focusing on storytelling or playing rather than gaming. Lastly, players may actually be competing against other players of who is best at <style=\"CurrentLink\">Playing to Lose</style>, something which may not be measured by the game state but even so can be judged by the players.",

            "<style=\"CurrentLink\">Playing to Lose</style> is mostly encouraged in Nordic-style <style=\"Link\"><link=\"http://virt10.itu.chalmers.se/index.php/Category:Live%20Action%20Roleplaying%20Games\">Live Action Roleplaying Games</link></style> such as <style=\"Link\"><link=\"http://virt10.itu.chalmers.se/index.php/Monitor%20Celestra\">Monitor Celestra</link></style> and <style=\"Link\"><link=\"http://virt10.itu.chalmers.se/index.php/College%20of%20Wizardry\">College of Wizardry</link></style>.

            "As explained above, the <style=\"CurrentLink\">Playing to Lose</style> does not actually focus on players' success or failure.

This requires that players have some level of <style=\"Link\"><link=\"http://virt10.itu.chalmers.se/index.php/Creative%20Control\">Creative Control</link></style> and that their <style=\"Link\"><link=\"characters\">Characters</link></style> have an <style=\"Link\"><link=\"open-destiny\">Open Destiny</link></style>. Besides this, designing for <style=\"CurrentLink\">Playing to Lose</style> consists of motivating players to <style=\"Link\"><link=\"roleplaying\">Roleplay</link></style> so their <style=\"Link\"><link=\"characters\">Characters</link></style> may diegetically sensible actions but which from a gameplay perspective may lead to bad consequences.

This by players making choices and actions for their <style=\"Link\"><link=\"characters\">Characters</link></style> that seem reasonable based on what the <style=\"Link\"><link=\"characters\">Characters</link></style> know but at the same time is likely to be bad from what the players' know.",
