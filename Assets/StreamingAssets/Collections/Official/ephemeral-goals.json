            "The two main structural design choices regarding <style=\"CurrentLink\">Ephemeral Goals</style> are when they should be introduced and when they should disappear. The introduction of these goals can either be by using <style=\"Link\"><link=\"randomness\">Randomness</link></style> or by observing the current game state. The latter is especially used to catch pacing problems and most common in roleplaying games moderated by <style=\"Link\"><link=\"game-masters\">Game Masters</link></style> since they can notice <style=\"Link\"><link=\"downtime\">Downtime</link></style> for players. In both cases the <style=\"CurrentLink\">Ephemeral Goals</style> are usually <style=\"Link\"><link=\"unknown-goals\">Unknown Goals</link></style>, either because their existence is unknown to players at the beginning of gameplay or because the exact nature of the goals, including when they will become known, is unknown. Games with <style=\"Link\"><link=\"evolving-rule-sets\">Evolving Rule Sets</link></style> often get <style=\"CurrentLink\">Ephemeral Goals</style> is a side effect of introducing new goals since their presences are unlikely to be known about by players before the update to the rule sets occurs.",
            "Many <style=\"CurrentLink\">Ephemeral Goals</style> can be failed simply because some other player or <style=\"Link\"><link=\"agents\">Agent</link></style> succeeds with them first, e.g. <style=\"Link\"><link=\"power-ups\">Power-Ups</link></style> taken by other players before one reaches them oneself, but any <style=\"Link\"><link=\"interruptible-actions\">Interruptible Action</link></style> also creates <style=\"CurrentLink\">Ephemeral Goals</style>. However, many <style=\"CurrentLink\">Ephemeral Goals</style> disappear after a certain <style=\"Link\"><link=\"time-limits\">Time Limit</link></style> have expired independently of other ways in which they can be failed. <style=\"CurrentLink\">Ephemeral Goals</style> can be modulated to be <style=\"Link\"><link=\"optional-goals\">Optional Goals</link></style> simply be not giving any <style=\"Link\"><link=\"penalties\">Penalties</link></style> at this point,  but other <style=\"CurrentLink\">Ephemeral Goals</style> can also be optional, for example those which do impose <style=\"Link\"><link=\"penalties\">Penalties</link></style> (and thus are a form of <style=\"Link\"><link=\"committed-goals\">Committed Goals</link></style>) but allow players to ignore them in order to concentrate on the main goals of the game. <style=\"Link\"><link=\"repeat-combos\">Repeat Combos</link></style> are examples of optional <style=\"CurrentLink\">Ephemeral Goals</style> based on <style=\"Link\"><link=\"time-limits\">Time Limits</link></style> without <style=\"Link\"><link=\"penalties\">Penalties</link></style> while <style=\"Link\"><link=\"quick-time-events\">Quick Time Events</link></style> are also based upon <style=\"Link\"><link=\"time-limits\">Time Limits</link></style> but do have <style=\"Link\"><link=\"penalties\">Penalties</link></style>",
            "<style=\"Link\"><link=\"quests\">Quests</link></style> is a very common form of <style=\"CurrentLink\">Ephemeral Goals</style>.

This principle is found in games with <style=\"Link\"><link=\"http://virt10.itu.chalmers.se/index.php/Resource%20Generators\">Resource Generators</link></style> that automatically produce game elements or <style=\"Link\"><link=\"http://virt10.itu.chalmers.se/index.php/Category:Roleplaying%20Games\">Roleplaying Games</link></style> that have random encounters. <style=\"CurrentLink\">Ephemeral Goals</style> can also be supported in games by allowing <style=\"Link\"><link=\"player-defined-goals\">Player-Defined Goals</link></style> to be defined during gameplay. These can either be encoded in the game system through explicit rules or be constructed outside the game system. In the latter case these goals automatically become <style=\"Link\"><link=\"optional-goals\">Optional Goals</link></style> as the definition then lies solely in the hands of the players.",

            "A way to vary a <style=\"Link\"><link=\"selectable-set-goals\">Selectable Set of Goals</link></style> during gameplay is to have some of the goals in the sets be <style=\"CurrentLink\">Ephemeral Goals</style> that are only available at certain times.",

Another way can be to make <style=\"CurrentLink\">Ephemeral Goals</style> into <style=\"Link\"><link=\"optional-goals\">Optional Goals</link></style> or packaging each of them as <style=\"Link\"><link=\"minigames\">Minigames</link></style>, as for example done with the taxi missions in <style=\"Link\"><link=\"http://virt10.itu.chalmers.se/index.php/Grand%20Theft%20Auto%203\">Grand Theft Auto 3</link></style>.",
