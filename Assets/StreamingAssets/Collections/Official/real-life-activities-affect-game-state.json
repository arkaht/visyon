            "Activities performed in game are typically activities done specifically to affect the games.

            "The energy usage in a household is the primary input to the game <style=\"Link\"><link=\"http://virt10.itu.chalmers.se/index.php/Power%20Explorer\">Power Explorer</link></style>, indirectly causing the players' everyday behavior affect the game through how much electrical energy their activities use.",

            "<style=\"H4\">Anti-Examples</style>",
            "The <style=\"Link\"><link=\"http://virt10.itu.chalmers.se/index.php/Rock%20Band%20series\">Rock Band series</link></style> and Wii games such as <style=\"Link\"><link=\"http://virt10.itu.chalmers.se/index.php/Wii%20Sports\">Wii Sports</link></style> are not examples of <style=\"CurrentLink\">Real Life Activities Affect Game State</style> even if they may cause players to become excited and exhausted.

Since <style=\"CurrentLink\">Real Life Activities Affect Game State</style> rewards those good at certain real world activities, knowledge of how to do those activities is beneficial for gameplay. This also leads to games having this pattern to be likely to have the pattern <style=\"Link\"><link=\"real-world-knowledge-advantages\">Real World Knowledge Advantages</link></style>. However, doing the activities with another purpose added may make players consider the activities in new ways, so the pattern can also give rise to <style=\"Link\"><link=\"changes-perception-real-world-phenomena-gameplay\">Changes in Perception of Real World Phenomena due to Gameplay</link></style>.
