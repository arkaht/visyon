            "The relative position in games can change during gameplay and in many games players can have a certain awareness of their position. <style=\"CurrentLink\">Speedending</style> occurs in games where not only players can know (or believe to know) that their position is that of the leader but can also influence the game to end sooner to avoid the risk of other overtaking them.",

            "One of the ways <style=\"Link\"><link=\"http://virt10.itu.chalmers.se/index.php/Dominion\">Dominion</link></style> ends is if three stacks of cards are depleted. A player can perform <style=\"CurrentLink\">Speedending</style> in this game by purposefully buying cards from nearly depleted decks even if they are not otherwise useful. More specifically, depleting only the deck of \"province\" cards ends the game so this can be a quicker but more costly way of doing <style=\"CurrentLink\">Speedending</style>. Similarly, <style=\"Link\"><link=\"http://virt10.itu.chalmers.se/index.php/Concordia\">Concordia</link></style> ends when all \"personality\" cards have been sold and players that wish to speedend this game can by these as often as possible.",
            "Players of <style=\"Link\"><link=\"http://virt10.itu.chalmers.se/index.php/Race%20for%20the%20Galaxy\">Race for the Galaxy</link></style> can engage in <style=\"CurrentLink\">Speedending</style> by playing cards both during \"develop\" and \"settle\" phases even if they cards played are not the best long-term investments.",
            "<style=\"H2\">Using the pattern</style>",
            "Being able to do <style=\"CurrentLink\">Speedending</style> in a game relies on players being able to judge their own position in relation to others, and that when they judge themselves leaders that they can influence the game to end. In addition, <style=\"CurrentLink\">Speedending</style> assumes <style=\"Link\"><link=\"winner-gameplay-ends\">Winner determined after Gameplay Ends</link></style> since if one is able to end the game by winning players will simply be more focused on winning instead of ending the game as quickly as possible (even if they may be performing the exact same actions).

In contrast to these rather direct means of satisfying the first condition for <style=\"CurrentLink\">Speedending</style>, means of letting players influence when a game ends are less precise. One typical construct is tying the <style=\"Link\"><link=\"complete-resource-depletion\">Complete Resource Depletion</link></style> of particular <style=\"Link\"><link=\"resources\">Resource</link></style>, e.g. \"province\" cards in <style=\"Link\"><link=\"http://virt10.itu.chalmers.se/index.php/Dominion\">Dominion</link></style>, to the game ending and providing player actions that consume the <style=\"Link\"><link=\"resources\">Resource</link></style>.",
