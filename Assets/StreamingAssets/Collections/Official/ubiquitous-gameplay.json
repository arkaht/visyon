            "Most games require technological platforms to be played or that preparations are made before gameplay begins, but even so, it may not be possible to play them due to other people being disturbed by the gameplay. Part of the problem is due to the fact a games rules, game state, and information typically require some form of medium so that players can perceive them. Further, those with complex algorithms that the players are not intended to calculate themselves require computers or game facilitators. Both these types of requirements limits where and when games can be played. Games that by design try to avoid these requirements, and thereby can be played more easily at any place and at any time, strive to have <style=\"CurrentLink\">Ubiquitous Gameplay</style>.",

Not requiring internet connections compared to requiring it is one example of how <style=\"CurrentLink\">Ubiquitous Gameplay</style> can be increased in a game, providing a dedicated computer instead of relying on an general-purpose one is another example (as is done by for example <style=\"Link\"><link=\"http://virt10.itu.chalmers.se/index.php/King%20Arthur\">King Arthur</link></style>). <style=\"Link\"><link=\"dedicated-game-facilitators\">Dedicated Game Facilitators</link></style> typically take the role of being both a medium for providing the gameplay and doing calculations needed for updating the game state.

            "Even avoiding computers and <style=\"Link\"><link=\"dedicated-game-facilitators\">Dedicated Game Facilitators</link></style> can pose problems to achieving <style=\"CurrentLink\">Ubiquitous Gameplay</style>.

The same applies to <style=\"Link\"><link=\"http://virt10.itu.chalmers.se/index.php/Tokens\">Tokens</link></style>; they are easily replaceable unless they do have to convey unique attributes (glass beads are used very often as <style=\"Link\"><link=\"http://virt10.itu.chalmers.se/index.php/Tokens\">Tokens</link></style> in <style=\"Link\"><link=\"http://virt10.itu.chalmers.se/index.php/Magic:%20The%20Gathering\">Magic: The Gathering</link></style> but not part of the actual game).
