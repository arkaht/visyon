            "Games are often played as a way to have social interaction with others. While the gameplay itself can in this way be a type of social interaction, games can pose obstacles for social interaction by requiring players to focus their attention on interacting with the game interface, updating the game state to reflect the effects of actions, or interacting with parts of the game system that isn't mediated to other players. Even when the games do not interrupt the flow of interaction between players, they may do so with non-players that the players are able to (or should be able to) interact with. While it may be impossible to fully avoid these issues, games that pose few obstacles to social interaction can be said to have <style=\"CurrentLink\">Minimalized Social Weight</style>.",

            "<style=\"H2\">Using the pattern</style>",

While deciding to aim for this is usually easy in a game design process, the pattern also typically conflicts with <style=\"Link\"><link=\"attention-demanding-gameplay\">Attention Demanding Gameplay</link></style> and choosing which pattern to support may be a tougher design decision.",
            "<style=\"Link\"><link=\"interruptibility\">Interruptibility</link></style> is one way of trying to minimize how much attention the game requires from players. This since even if players may need to focus on the gameplay while played they can easily stop to engage in social interaction with others.

            "While <style=\"Link\"><link=\"self-facilitated-games\">Self-Facilitated Games</link></style> do provide <style=\"Link\"><link=\"excise\">Excise</link></style>, they do provide <style=\"CurrentLink\">Minimalized Social Weight</style> since players can whenever they wish to interrupt non-social gameplay and <style=\"Link\"><link=\"excise\">Excise</link></style> to have social interaction outside the game. Note that requiring or supporting <style=\"Link\"><link=\"http://virt10.itu.chalmers.se/index.php/Social%20Interaction\">Social Interaction</link></style> does not in itself make games have <style=\"CurrentLink\">Minimalized Social Weight</style>, this both because interaction within the gameplay may be strongly affected by the game and because the pattern may also refer to interaction with non-players.",
            "<style=\"H3\">Interface Aspects</style>",
            "Besides the actual interaction required with a game's interface (which is part of the discussion above), the design of the interface can add social weight to a game. Interfaces that are difficult or time-consuming to use add social weight as do those that draw attention to themselves through their appearance. One example of how games can draw attention to themselves purely through the interface - and thereby work against the pattern of <style=\"CurrentLink\">Minimalized Social Weight</style> - is through having <style=\"Link\"><link=\"http://virt10.itu.chalmers.se/index.php/Juicy%20Interfaces\">Juicy Interfaces</link></style>. <style=\"Link\"><link=\"mimetic-interfaces\">Mimetic Interfaces</link></style> is another, in which the players are made to draw attention to the gamed by how they interface with them.",
