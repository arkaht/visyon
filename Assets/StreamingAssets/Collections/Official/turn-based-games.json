            "Many games separate gameplay into easily understandable units where some actions are allowed and others not allowed. Most traditional games follow this pattern by letting one player plan and then execute an action as a turn and then letting another player do a turn, alternating until the game is finished. Turns are in this way typically used to describe periods of gameplay when one player can plan without risk of interruption to select and perform one action. However, this can challenged in various ways in games while still having them be perceived as having turns, e.g. by having several players do turns simultaneously, being able to do several actions, introducing time limits to make the actions, or letting other players have the possibility of interrupting turns. ",
            "Games with more complex structures of organizing gameplay can have turn-like structures on many levels. To distinguish between these rounds, phases, and segments are often introduced as concepts, while turns typically signify when players make important choices that need several steps to evaluate or get to make an uninterrupted series of actions. The players' perception of the gameplay is often the determining factor if a game is called turn-based rather than its internal structure. This is the case why not all computer games have seen as turn-based, even if they do have clearly defined states at all points due to being programs.",
            "<style=\"H3\">Examples</style>",
            "In <style=\"Link\"><link=\"http://virt10.itu.chalmers.se/index.php/Chess\">Chess</link></style> and <style=\"Link\"><link=\"http://virt10.itu.chalmers.se/index.php/Go\">Go</link></style>, the players take turns to move or place their pieces on the board. In the basic variant, there is no strict time limit for the players to execute their turns apart from social pressure exerted by the other player while in tournaments this may be enforced due to practical reasons. <style=\"Link\"><link=\"http://virt10.itu.chalmers.se/index.php/Diplomacy\">Diplomacy</link></style> is an early example of letting players simultaneously have turns, alternating between letting them negotiate with each other for a predetermined period of time and then executing their chosen actions. <style=\"Link\"><link=\"http://virt10.itu.chalmers.se/index.php/RoboRally\">RoboRally</link></style> is a newer example where players simultaneously decide the next five actions for their robots and then execute them in parallel. <style=\"Link\"><link=\"http://virt10.itu.chalmers.se/index.php/Ricochet%20Robots\">Ricochet Robots</link></style> uses a similar structure, with each turn letting all players participate in a time-limited bidding in how few moves they can solve a movement puzzle, and then letting the lowest bidder show his or her solution in an ''proving'' phase.",
            "The computer games <style=\"Link\"><link=\"http://virt10.itu.chalmers.se/index.php/Laser%20Squad%20Nemesis\">Laser Squad Nemesis</link></style> and the <style=\"Link\"><link=\"http://virt10.itu.chalmers.se/index.php/Combat%20Mission%20series\">Combat Mission series</link></style> offer the players modes for hot-seating, switching the player whose turn it is, and sending the turn information via e-mail to the other player. The <style=\"Link\"><link=\"http://virt10.itu.chalmers.se/index.php/Civilization%20(video%20game)%20series\">Civilization</link></style> video game series has a turn-based structure in which a player may move all his or her units based upon an action point system, showing an example of more complex division of how to separate gameplay. <style=\"Link\"><link=\"http://virt10.itu.chalmers.se/index.php/Bloodbowl\">Bloodbowl</link></style> does the same but enforces that one unit's actions are finished before activating the next unit.

            "The two-person board game <style=\"Link\"><link=\"http://virt10.itu.chalmers.se/index.php/Space%20Hulk\">Space Hulk</link></style> also has a similar structure, but also has strict time limits on the player controlling the human marines.

Similarly, the board game <style=\"Link\"><link=\"http://virt10.itu.chalmers.se/index.php/Space%20Alert\">Space Alert</link></style> has a real-time planning phase followed by a execution phase when they are executed. By separating all the planning and all the execution into two phases, the game also challenges the turn-based structure. ",

            "Avoiding <style=\"Link\"><link=\"turn-taking\">Turn Taking</link></style> requires that rules exists concerning all players rather than just one player to determine when turns end.
