            "An archetypical <style=\"CurrentLink\">Symmetric Goal</style> is that of a simple race. The goal each player has is symmetric to the others since each player needs to get to the end of the race (be it a spatial race or otherwise) before other players do. Another typical example of <style=\"CurrentLink\">Symmetric Goals</style> can be found in the Japanese version of <style=\"Link\"><link=\"http://virt10.itu.chalmers.se/index.php/Go\">Go</link></style> where each player has the goal to surround the highest number of empty spaces (other versions of <style=\"Link\"><link=\"http://virt10.itu.chalmers.se/index.php/Go\">Go</link></style> also have <style=\"CurrentLink\">Symmetric Goals</style>). While this can be described as an abstract race since the number of spaces are limited, the <style=\"CurrentLink\">Symmetric Goals</style> in <style=\"Link\"><link=\"http://virt10.itu.chalmers.se/index.php/Chess\">Chess</link></style> of trying to checkmate each other's kings show an example of <style=\"CurrentLink\">Symmetric Goals</style> which are not a race.",

            "<style=\"CurrentLink\">Symmetric Goals</style> are often used to modify <style=\"Link\"><link=\"http://virt10.itu.chalmers.se/index.php/Conflicts\">Conflicts</link></style> and <style=\"Link\"><link=\"http://virt10.itu.chalmers.se/index.php/Competition\">Competitions</link></style>. One reason for this is to provide <style=\"Link\"><link=\"player-balance\">Player Balance</link></style> (this assumes that all players have the same <style=\"CurrentLink\">Symmetric Goals</style>).

Similarly, <style=\"Link\"><link=\"king-hill\">King of the Hill</link></style> provides several players with having an exclusive position and hindering other players from taking that position from them. As <style=\"Link\"><link=\"overcome\">Overcome</link></style> goals provides targets with a goal to avoid being <style=\"Link\"><link=\"overcome\">Overcome</link></style>, games with this pattern create <style=\"CurrentLink\">Symmetric Goals</style> as long as the opponent has some actions which can be used offensively to avoid being <style=\"Link\"><link=\"overcome\">Overcome</link></style>, i.e. the avoidance goal can be fulfilled by overcoming the one with the <style=\"Link\"><link=\"overcome\">Overcome</link></style> goal. While it may be easy to simply consider all <style=\"CurrentLink\">Symmetric Goals</style> as being based upon some form of <style=\"Link\"><link=\"http://virt10.itu.chalmers.se/index.php/Conflicts\">Conflict</link></style>, players sharing <style=\"Link\"><link=\"mutual-goals\">Mutual Goals</link></style> have <style=\"CurrentLink\">Symmetric Goals</style> also since these goals are the same goals. <style=\"CurrentLink\">Symmetric Goals</style> are often also <style=\"Link\"><link=\"interferable-goals\">Interferable Goals</link></style>, and this can be how they become symmetric as the <style=\"Link\"><link=\"overcome\">Overcome</link></style> goal shows an example of.",
