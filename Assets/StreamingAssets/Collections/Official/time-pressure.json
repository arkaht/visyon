            "Whenever players need to complete an activity and perceive that they have limited time they may feel <style=\"CurrentLink\">Time Pressure</style>. The time available may be presented to players very concrete, e.g. explicitly pointed out to players as time left to complete something, but may also not be presented at all (as long as players are made aware of the pressure at some point). However, the amount of time available can be undecided while still creating stress for the players, e.g. when they are pitched against each other to complete a race or puzzle as quickly as possible. ",
            "<style=\"H3\">Examples</style>",
            "Many racing games, e.g. <style=\"Link\"><link=\"http://virt10.itu.chalmers.se/index.php/Out%20Run\">Out Run</link></style> and <style=\"Link\"><link=\"http://virt10.itu.chalmers.se/index.php/Sega%20Rally\">Sega Rally</link></style>, give players a limited amount of time to reach a check point, and thereby put them under stress. Successfully getting there before the time has run out replenishes the time left but typically so that one is under even more <style=\"CurrentLink\">Time Pressure</style> to reach the next check point.",
            "The survival mode in the <style=\"Link\"><link=\"http://virt10.itu.chalmers.se/index.php/Left%204%20Dead%20series\">Left 4 Dead series</link></style> make people strive for as long as possible to avoid getting overwhelmed by zombies. By having three different levels of success players have a time-related pressure that consist not of finishing something as quickly as possible but avoiding failure for as long as possible.",
            "Turn-based games such as <style=\"Link\"><link=\"http://virt10.itu.chalmers.se/index.php/Chess\">Chess</link></style> and <style=\"Link\"><link=\"http://virt10.itu.chalmers.se/index.php/Go\">Go</link></style> often have implicit <style=\"CurrentLink\">Time Pressure</style> as other players have to wait while one player is playing. This <style=\"CurrentLink\">Time Pressure</style> is typically formalized in tournament forms of the game to make it easier to synchronize the different games.",
            "Each turn in the board game <style=\"Link\"><link=\"http://virt10.itu.chalmers.se/index.php/Ricochet%20Robots\">Ricochet Robots</link></style> put players in the situation where they not only have to solve a puzzle but also do so quicker than the other players. This stresses players to quickly find a solution while making it uncertain how long time they have until they need to find a more efficient solution than is currently sufficient.",
            "The casual game <style=\"Link\"><link=\"http://virt10.itu.chalmers.se/index.php/Staries\">Staries</link></style> penalizes players that take too long time to make a move by locking stars on the game board. There is however done with no forewarning after a move has been done so players are implicitly stressed to make moves as quickly as possible.",

These can then easily be communicated to players through <style=\"Link\"><link=\"game-state-indicators\">Game State Indicators</link></style> and <style=\"Link\"><link=\"alarms\">Alarms</link></style>, which may or may not clearly express needs to be done hastily or what the consequences of failing will be.

            "An alternative to have time run out is to create <style=\"Link\"><link=\"continuous-goals\">Continuous Goals</link></style> to need to be maintain for a certain amount of time, where the <style=\"Link\"><link=\"survive\">Survive</link></style> goal is a clear example of this.",
            "Besides deciding the reasons for the <style=\"CurrentLink\">Time Pressure</style> the amount of time available needs to be decided. This needs to be balanced against the intentions of <style=\"Link\"><link=\"complex-gameplay\">Complex Gameplay</link></style> since for example a <style=\"Link\"><link=\"http://virt10.itu.chalmers.se/index.php/Time%20Limit\">Time Limit</link></style> that may stress a novice player may not imply any pressure on an expert player. Note that <style=\"CurrentLink\">Time Pressure</style> does not need to be limited to <style=\"Link\"><link=\"real-time-games\">Real-Time Games</link></style> or <style=\"Link\"><link=\"tick-based-games\">Tick-Based Games</link></style>; the turns in <style=\"Link\"><link=\"turn-based-games\">Turn-Based Games</link></style> can provide a measure of time as well. ",
            "<style=\"CurrentLink\">Time Pressure</style> can also be created by setting up players to compete with each other in being the first to achieve a certain objective in the game (i.e. they have the same <style=\"Link\"><link=\"symmetric-goals\">Symmetric</link></style> and <style=\"Link\"><link=\"interferable-goals\">Interferable</link></style> goal as for example in <style=\"Link\"><link=\"http://virt10.itu.chalmers.se/index.php/Ricochet%20Robots\">Ricochet Robots</link></style>).
