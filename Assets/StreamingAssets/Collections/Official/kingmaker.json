            "Games provide players with possibilities to do actions that can influence their own and other players' positions in the game state. While players typically try to improve their own situations &mdash; otherwise they are arguable not gaming &mdash; this is not always possible. Something players can perform actions but only positively affect the situations of other players. Taken to the extreme, this can allow, or force, a player to make an action that determines who will win a game as long as it isn't the player itself. Such players are [[Kingmaker|Kingmakers]]. ",

            "The possibility of [[Kingmaker]] situation in games are in many cases unwanted so it is usually a [[:Category:Negative Patterns|Negative Pattern]]. [[Kingmaker]] typically occurs in the [[Endgame]] of a game since this is when positions are more or less established. The typical causes for it to occur are [[Dominant Strategies]], [[Early Elimination]], [[Early Leaving Players]], [[Predictable Consequences]], [[Predictable Winner]], [[Possibility of Graceful Surrender]], and [[Unwinnable Game States]] so one strategy to avoid [[Kingmaker]] possibilities is to avoid those patterns. ",
            "If the presence of [[Kingmaker]] situations have been observed in a game, there are some design features that can work against it occurring. [[Balancing Effects]], [[Randomness]], and [[Uncertainty of Outcome]] works against [[Predictable Consequences]] or a [[Predictable Winner]] making a [[Kingmaker]] emerge. [[Imperfect Information]] and [[Uncertainty of Information]] can make players not realize that there actually exists a [[Kingmaker]] situation; [[:Category:Board Games|Board Games]] with [[Scores]] often do this by having at least some of the [[Scores]] be hidden (see for example [[Lords of Waterdeep]], [[Ticket to Ride]], and [[Village]]). ",
            "[[Kingmaker]] can also be mitigated by [[Exaggerated Perception of Influence]] (which can trick players into believing they have a chance to win and thereby not engage in kingmaking. It can also be mitigated by giving players [[Value of Effort]] for their gameplay so they don't end or unbalance game instances just because they themselves cannot win. [[Revoke Rules]] can offer a less bad option in [[Kingmaker]] situations by letting players suffer a penalty for a violation of the rules but without necessarily losing the game."

        "consequences" : [
            "[[Kingmaker]] typically occurs in the [[Endgame]] when players' positions tend to rather clearly established. This makes the number of candidates for winning narrower and in this sense [[Kingmaker]] can help players perceive a [[Predictable Winner]]. Just as [[Balancing Effects]] can work against [[Kingmaker]] situations occurring, the presence of [[Kingmaker]] possibilities work against [[Player Balance]] and therefore against [[Balancing Effects]] as well.
