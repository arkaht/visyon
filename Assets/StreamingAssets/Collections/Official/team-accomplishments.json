Since working together can require skills, this can in itself become an accomplishment so <style=\"CurrentLink\">Team Accomplishments</style> can also be simply managing to work together towards a game goal without actually succeeding, or even just identifying how one could work together.",

            "Examples of <style=\"CurrentLink\">Team Accomplishments</style> typically come from cooperative games, such as <style=\"Link\"><link=\"http://virt10.itu.chalmers.se/index.php/Battlestar%20Galactica:%20The%20Board%20Game\">Battlestar Galactica: The Board Game</link></style>, the <style=\"Link\"><link=\"http://virt10.itu.chalmers.se/index.php/Left%204%20Dead%20series\">Left 4 Dead series</link></style>, <style=\"Link\"><link=\"http://virt10.itu.chalmers.se/index.php/Pandemic\">Pandemic</link></style>, and <style=\"Link\"><link=\"http://virt10.itu.chalmers.se/index.php/Yggdrasil\">Yggdrasil</link></style>.
