This however requires that the design has a <style=\"CurrentLink\">Thematic Consistency</style>; that is, it complies to conventions and other previously established features recognized as a specific theme.

            "Besides the value of being exotic, it is very common for games to make use of themes including magic or science fiction elements since they allow a wider range of possible actions and game elements while still maintaining <style=\"CurrentLink\">Thematic Consistency</style>. To take just two examples, <style=\"Link\"><link=\"http://virt10.itu.chalmers.se/index.php/Dungeons%20&%20Dragons\">Dungeons & Dragons</link></style> has created a setting combining magic and personal development to support and explain the leveling of characters done in it and the designers of the <style=\"Link\"><link=\"http://virt10.itu.chalmers.se/index.php/Fallout%20series\">Fallout series</link></style> makes use of a paradoxical futuristic-but-50ies setting to allow themselves to include both aliens and serious sub-themes into the gameplay.",

            "<style=\"H2\">Using the pattern</style>",
            "A primary design choice that affects <style=\"CurrentLink\">Thematic Consistency</style> is what diegetic theme the game has, and this not only affects how things should be presented in games but also how they should behave. For example, while <style=\"Link\"><link=\"early-elimination\">Early Elimination</link></style> is often not seen as a desirable pattern to have in a game the diegetic theme of a game together with the wish to have <style=\"CurrentLink\">Thematic Consistency</style> might require its presence. For games that do not strive to be (initially) historical, this means that the pattern is modulated by <style=\"Link\"><link=\"http://virt10.itu.chalmers.se/index.php/Alternative%20Realities\">Alternative Realities</link></style>. Examples of games that avoid <style=\"Link\"><link=\"http://virt10.itu.chalmers.se/index.php/Alternative%20Realities\">Alternative Realities</link></style> are <style=\"Link\"><link=\"http://virt10.itu.chalmers.se/index.php/Category:Wargames\">Wargames</link></style>, both such as <style=\"Link\"><link=\"http://virt10.itu.chalmers.se/index.php/Advanced%20Squad%20Leader\">Advanced Squad Leader</link></style> and <style=\"Link\"><link=\"http://virt10.itu.chalmers.se/index.php/Rommel%20in%20the%20Desert\">Rommel in the Desert</link></style> that focus upon squads or smaller units and grand strategy games such as <style=\"Link\"><link=\"http://virt10.itu.chalmers.se/index.php/Diplomacy\">Diplomacy</link></style> and the <style=\"Link\"><link=\"http://virt10.itu.chalmers.se/index.php/Hearts%20of%20Iron%20series\">Hearts of Iron series</link></style>, and for the types of games it may be necessary to have <style=\"Link\"><link=\"asymmetric-starting-conditions\">Asymmetric Starting Conditions</link></style> in order to have <style=\"CurrentLink\">Thematic Consistency</style>. Another issue is to what level of detail the theme should be implemented and this can make it impossible to satisfy all players that a game has <style=\"CurrentLink\">Thematic Consistency</style> - having believable behaviors from <style=\"Link\"><link=\"non-player-characters\">Non-Player Characters</link></style>, or <style=\"Link\"><link=\"player-characters\">Player Characters</link></style> for that fact, is one area where expectations can vary wildly between players. For <style=\"Link\"><link=\"self-facilitated-games\">Self-Facilitated Games</link></style> it is impossible to guarantee <style=\"CurrentLink\">Thematic Consistency</style> since players can add their own descriptions, but they can be encouraged by being provided with a thematically consistent set of game content to begin with. Providing <style=\"Link\"><link=\"optional-rules\">Optional Rules</link></style> is a way to let players set the rules to fit their opinions of the theme as well as possible, and thereby modulate how well the game has a <style=\"CurrentLink\">Thematic Consistency</style>. <style=\"Link\"><link=\"evolving-rule-sets\">Evolving Rule Sets</link></style> do the same but can be applied during gameplay to make the rules better comply with the theme.",
            "The theme of a game can not only influence how game elements should be presented but also more or less require their presence in some cases. Game elements that can help create <style=\"CurrentLink\">Thematic Consistency</style> but are also restricted in how they can be realized by the theme include <style=\"Link\"><link=\"alarms\">Alarms</link></style>, <style=\"Link\"><link=\"avatars\">Avatars</link></style>, <style=\"Link\"><link=\"boss-monsters\">Boss Monsters</link></style>, <style=\"Link\"><link=\"clues\">Clues</link></style> (but not those created as <style=\"Link\"><link=\"non-diegetic-features\">Non-Diegetic Features</link></style>), <style=\"Link\"><link=\"companions\">Companions</link></style>, <style=\"Link\"><link=\"enemies\">Enemies</link></style>, <style=\"Link\"><link=\"environmental-effects\">Environmental Effects</link></style>, <style=\"Link\"><link=\"game-items\">Game Items</link></style>, <style=\"Link\"><link=\"landmarks\">Landmarks</link></style>, <style=\"Link\"><link=\"tools\">Tools</link></style>, <style=\"Link\"><link=\"traces\">Traces</link></style>, and <style=\"Link\"><link=\"units\">Units</link></style>. <style=\"Link\"><link=\"controllers\">Controllers</link></style> may also be inserted because they are implied by themes, but they also provide possibilities of having gameplay effects be dislocated from players' <style=\"Link\"><link=\"focus-loci\">Focus Loci</link></style>, and working on other power levels, without breaking the <style=\"CurrentLink\">Thematic Consistency</style>. <style=\"Link\"><link=\"big-dumb-objects\">Big Dumb Objects</link></style> and <style=\"Link\"><link=\"props\">Props</link></style> may in contrast to the previous examples be inserted mainly to instantiate <style=\"CurrentLink\">Thematic Consistency</style> given facts related to history or an <style=\"Link\"><link=\"http://virt10.itu.chalmers.se/index.php/Alternative%20Realities\">Alternative Reality</link></style>; <style=\"Link\"><link=\"feelies\">Feelies</link></style> do this but through using a physical medium. <style=\"Link\"><link=\"alien-space-bats\">Alien Space Bats</link></style> do the same but strain players suspension of disbelief more and when this breaks works against the pattern instead. <style=\"Link\"><link=\"power-ups\">Power-Ups</link></style> also strain players suspension of disbelief but in this case since they quite obviously are present to present gameplay effects. The theme can motivate several of the ways these can be modulated, e.g. by being <style=\"Link\"><link=\"destructible-objects\">Destructible Objects</link></style>, <style=\"Link\"><link=\"diegetically-tangible-game-items\">Diegetically Tangible Game Items</link></style>, or making use of <style=\"Link\"><link=\"inventories\">Inventories</link></style> (although the latter can easily work against <style=\"CurrentLink\">Thematic Consistency</style> depending on the physical considerations made in the system). <style=\"Link\"><link=\"construction\">Construction</link></style> can be used to motivate how they are introduced to the games while the contents of <style=\"Link\"><link=\"loot\">Loot</link></style> need to comply to themes to maintain <style=\"CurrentLink\">Thematic Consistency</style>. <style=\"Link\"><link=\"sets\">Sets</link></style> are interesting in that they are nearly always thematically consistent with each other even when the game which contains them is not, and here the <style=\"CurrentLink\">Thematic Consistency</style> between them helps define them. While <style=\"Link\"><link=\"macguffins\">MacGuffins</link></style> are less restricted in their appearance by <style=\"CurrentLink\">Thematic Consistency</style> (in fact, for them to fit some themes they should only be indirectly referred to), their presence can be required by the same theme that specifically does not care about how they are represented. <style=\"Link\"><link=\"geospatial-game-widgets\">Geospatial Game Widgets</link></style>, e.g. <style=\"Link\"><link=\"ghosts\">Ghosts</link></style>, are objects positioned within <style=\"Link\"><link=\"game-worlds\">Game Worlds</link></style> that break not only <style=\"CurrentLink\">Thematic Consistency</style> but also <style=\"Link\"><link=\"diegetic-consistency\">Diegetic Consistency</link></style> in not being diegetically present in those <style=\"Link\"><link=\"game-worlds\">Game Worlds</link></style>. <style=\"Link\"><link=\"invulnerabilities\">Invulnerabilities</link></style> of diegetic individuals and items can easily work against <style=\"CurrentLink\">Thematic Consistency</style> unless given thematic explanations - this can be a problem for game designs because the <style=\"Link\"><link=\"invulnerabilities\">Invulnerabilities</link></style> may exist implicitly due to the fact that no rules (and representations) may have been created for this purpose or because they are vital to <style=\"Link\"><link=\"predetermined-story-structures\">Predetermined Story Structures</link></style> and have for this reason been given explicit <style=\"Link\"><link=\"invulnerabilities\">Invulnerabilities</link></style>.",
            "Many themes imply large <style=\"Link\"><link=\"game-worlds\">Game Worlds</link></style>, and <style=\"Link\"><link=\"illusion-open-space\">Illusion of Open Space</link></style> or <style=\"Link\"><link=\"procedurally-generated-game-worlds\">Procedurally Generated Game Worlds</link></style> can help support <style=\"CurrentLink\">Thematic Consistency</style> concerning this. Worth noting is that <style=\"Link\"><link=\"invisible-walls\">Invisible Walls</link></style> is a common way to create <style=\"Link\"><link=\"illusion-open-space\">Illusion of Open Space</link></style> and can in this way support <style=\"CurrentLink\">Thematic Consistency</style> but it is a volatile solution since the pattern works against the consistency if noticed. Related to having large <style=\"Link\"><link=\"game-worlds\">Game Worlds</link></style> is the question of having sufficient amount of game objects within these to be believable environments.  <style=\"Link\"><link=\"props\">Props</link></style> and <style=\"Link\"><link=\"red-herrings\">Red Herrings</link></style> can help populate the <style=\"Link\"><link=\"game-worlds\">Game Worlds</link></style> to the right density but for large <style=\"Link\"><link=\"game-worlds\">Game Worlds</link></style> it may be necessary to do this through having <style=\"Link\"><link=\"procedurally-generated-game-worlds\">Procedurally Generated Game Worlds</link></style> that also generate the game objects within them.",
            "One aspect of game element design that is required for <style=\"CurrentLink\">Thematic Consistency</style> to be maintained is that there are no contradictions or irregularities in the functioning of the game. For example, if players can blow up one crate in a game, then players should also be able to blow up all other crates that look similar. Not being able to do so breaks the consistency by making some game elements function according to the theme while making others by <style=\"Link\"><link=\"props\">Props</link></style> (for a more detailed discussion, see Linderoth 2007<ref name=\"Linderoth\"/>). <style=\"Link\"><link=\"friendly-fire\">Friendly Fire</link></style>, that attacks can hurt team members and not only <style=\"Link\"><link=\"enemies\">Enemies</link></style>, is a pattern that supports the thematic consistency that weapons affect targets equally but is uncommon enough that it merits as a design option. Similarly, <style=\"Link\"><link=\"variable-accuracy\">Variable Accuracy</link></style> can be used to simulate the difficulties in hitting targets due to wind, fatigue, stress, and other factors that affect real world shooting. A more general issue with <style=\"CurrentLink\">Thematic Consistency</style> occurs when there is a need or wish to use <style=\"Link\"><link=\"regenerating-resources\">Regenerating Resources</link></style> since few real world <style=\"Link\"><link=\"resources\">Resources</link></style> can be replenished at the speed with gameplay might dictate; the use of fictional worlds can remove this issue.",
            "<style=\"CurrentLink\">Thematic Consistency</style> does not only concern game elements.

In fact, one aspect of <style=\"CurrentLink\">Thematic Consistency</style> which may be more difficult for games than other mediums are to make the behavior of <style=\"Link\"><link=\"agents\">Agents</link></style> believable. This since it requires some form of <style=\"Link\"><link=\"enforced-agent-behavior\">Enforced Agent Behavior</link></style> while they should still be interactive. For <style=\"Link\"><link=\"non-player-characters\">Non-Player Characters</link></style> and other <style=\"Link\"><link=\"agents\">Agents</link></style> run either by <style=\"Link\"><link=\"algorithmic-agents\">Algorithmic Agents</link></style> or <style=\"Link\"><link=\"dedicated-game-facilitators\">Dedicated Game Facilitators</link></style> such as <style=\"Link\"><link=\"game-masters\">Game Masters</link></style> it is easy to enforce the behaviors but trying to capture enough nuances of human behavior can require a host of other patterns, including <style=\"Link\"><link=\"actions-have-diegetically-social-consequences\">Actions Have Diegetically Social Consequences</link></style>, <style=\"Link\"><link=\"awareness-surroundings\">Awareness of Surroundings</link></style>, <style=\"Link\"><link=\"character-development\">Character Development</link></style>, <style=\"Link\"><link=\"emotional-attachment\">Emotional Attachment</link></style>, <style=\"Link\"><link=\"goal-driven-personal-development\">Goal-Driven Personal Development</link></style>, <style=\"Link\"><link=\"initiative\">Initiative</link></style>, <style=\"Link\"><link=\"open-destiny\">Open Destiny</link></style>, <style=\"Link\"><link=\"own-agenda\">Own Agenda</link></style>, <style=\"Link\"><link=\"player-character-skill-composites\">Player/Character Skill Composites</link></style>, <style=\"Link\"><link=\"sense-self\">Sense of Self</link></style>, <style=\"Link\"><link=\"http://virt10.itu.chalmers.se/index.php/Thematically%20Consistent%20Dialogues\">Thematically Consistent Dialogues</link></style>, and <style=\"Link\"><link=\"unpredictable-behavior\">Unpredictable Behavior</link></style>. <style=\"Link\"><link=\"ephemeral-goals\">Ephemeral Goals</link></style> can play a role here in that they can help give the impression that <style=\"Link\"><link=\"agents\">Agents</link></style> have their <style=\"Link\"><link=\"own-agenda\">Own Agenda</link></style> even if this is not implemented on a game system level. <style=\"Link\"><link=\"crafting\">Crafting</link></style> is somewhat of a special case here since it is a behavior of <style=\"Link\"><link=\"agents\">Agents</link></style> but one whose effect can be used to explain how <style=\"Link\"><link=\"game-items\">Game Items</link></style> are created. Looking more generally on this aspect, <style=\"Link\"><link=\"http://virt10.itu.chalmers.se/index.php/Fa%C3%A7ade\">Façade</link></style>, and to a lesser degree the <style=\"Link\"><link=\"http://virt10.itu.chalmers.se/index.php/Sims%20series\">Sims series</link></style>, are examples of games that have put significant resources into designing support for this kind of social <style=\"CurrentLink\">Thematic Consistency</style>.

When the behavior of <style=\"Link\"><link=\"agents\">Agents</link></style> or how game rules can simulate physics are not sufficient to maintain <style=\"CurrentLink\">Thematic Consistency</style>, this can be solved by replacing some diegetic game events through <style=\"Link\"><link=\"cutscenes\">Cutscenes</link></style>. <style=\"Link\"><link=\"mules\">Mules</link></style> are a special case of <style=\"Link\"><link=\"agents\">Agents</link></style> that are likely to break <style=\"CurrentLink\">Thematic Consistency</style> - this since they are likely to not behave consistency with the behavior of players that sometimes take control of them.",
