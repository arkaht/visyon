            "In one sense, all games require ''some'' space in the real world, even if it is through computers or other machines that enable them. However, a distinction can be made for games where players physically need to move their entire bodies to new locations in order to game. In these cases, the games can be said to have <style=\"CurrentLink\">Real World Gameplay Spaces</style> in which the gameplay takes place which either denies that space to other activities or leads to the two activities sharing the space. Similarly, games where the game elements moved are large enough to interfere significantly with other activities in the same space can be said to have <style=\"CurrentLink\">Real World Gameplay Spaces</style>.",

            "The pattern <style=\"CurrentLink\">Real World Gameplay Spaces</style> can quite easily be part of a game through defining a physical space and specifying how this related to gameplay actions. The simplest of these relations is to define that actions can only be performed within the space but the introduction of <style=\"CurrentLink\">Real World Gameplay Spaces</style> open up for several specific other patterns, namely those related to physical proximity. The most common of these are probably <style=\"Link\"><link=\"player-artifact-proximity\">Player-Artifact Proximity</link></style>, <style=\"Link\"><link=\"player-location-proximity\">Player-Location Proximity</link></style>, and <style=\"Link\"><link=\"player-player-proximity\">Player-Player Proximity</link></style>.",

It should be noted however that properly designed games with <style=\"CurrentLink\">Real World Gameplay Spaces</style> can allow <style=\"Link\"><link=\"pervasive-gameplay\">Pervasive Gameplay</link></style> so the patterns can instantiate each other. <style=\"Link\"><link=\"crossmedia-gameplay\">Crossmedia Gameplay</link></style> can make games indirectly have <style=\"CurrentLink\">Real World Gameplay Spaces</style> by making players need to move in the real world to access the different media used in the games.",

However, these games can be localized to small enclosed area where the spatial aspects become irrelevant. For this reason, <style=\"CurrentLink\">Real World Gameplay Spaces</style> is a possible way to modify games with <style=\"Link\"><link=\"live-action-roleplaying\">Live Action Roleplaying</link></style> by making spatial movement or distances a feature in the gameplay.",
