            "<style=\"CurrentLink\">No-Use Bonus</style> is a pattern that can help load balance the use of the actions made possible by <style=\"Link\"><link=\"role-selection\">Role Selection</link></style> or, less commonly, shared systems using <style=\"Link\"><link=\"budgeted-action-points\">Budgeted Action Points</link></style>. The main design choices when introducing it consists of what <style=\"Link\"><link=\"resources\">Resource</link></style> to add, although <style=\"Link\"><link=\"http://virt10.itu.chalmers.se/index.php/Money\">Money</link></style> may be the most natural unless the actions already have some other <style=\"Link\"><link=\"resources\">Resources</link></style> associated with them.",

It also rebalances the value of the possible options in systems of <style=\"Link\"><link=\"budgeted-action-points\">Budgeted Action Points</link></style> and <style=\"Link\"><link=\"role-selection\">Role Selection</link></style> each time it is applied, and this value change is independent of the rest of a game state. By doing so it modulates the possibilities of <style=\"Link\"><link=\"predictable-consequences\">Predictable Consequences</link></style> in a game - some choices may become easier to predict (e.g. an action that has received several <style=\"CurrentLink\">No-Use Bonuses</style> is quite likely to be chosen) but other choices may be more difficult because players are introduced to new <style=\"Link\"><link=\"trade-offs\">Trade-Offs</link></style> between actions.",
