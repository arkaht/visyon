            "Not all goals in games are created by game designers. Player can easily create their own goals in a game making use of possible game states and actions available to themselves, and thereby add <style=\"CurrentLink\">Player-Defined Goals</style> to any game. However, games can encourage this through their design and even have rules on how such goals can be set up as well as check when they have been completed (although this of course does not hinder players from adding other <style=\"CurrentLink\">Player-Defined Goals</style> that ignore these rules).",
            "<style=\"H3\">Examples</style>",
            "<style=\"CurrentLink\">Player-Defined Goals</style> are employed generally in <style=\"Link\"><link=\"http://virt10.itu.chalmers.se/index.php/Diplomacy\">Diplomacy</link></style> as players can set their own secret goals and strategies, but the impact of the patterns is more evident when some players agree to form (often secret) pacts against other players. However, the goals are only agreements between players and they are not explicitly stated in the game mechanics or rules.",
            "The <style=\"Link\"><link=\"http://virt10.itu.chalmers.se/index.php/SimCity%20series\">SimCity series</link></style> and most of other <style=\"Link\"><link=\"http://virt10.itu.chalmers.se/index.php/Category:Simulation%20Games\">Simulation Games</link></style> (for example <style=\"Link\"><link=\"http://virt10.itu.chalmers.se/index.php/Minecraft\">Minecraft</link></style>) are good examples of games where <style=\"CurrentLink\">Player-Defined Goals</style> are not only possible but also integral to the rewarding gameplay. This since the gameplay often is open to the point where there are no winning conditions and interacting with the games without your own goals easily becomes perceived as meaningless.",
            "<style=\"H2\">Using the pattern</style>",
            "Games can provide support for defining the <style=\"CurrentLink\">Player-Defined Goals</style> so the game system can automatically detect successes and failure as well as applying <style=\"Link\"><link=\"penalties\">Penalties</link></style> or <style=\"Link\"><link=\"rewards\">Rewards</link></style>. However, this is not necessary for <style=\"CurrentLink\">Player-Defined Goals</style> to be part of a game design. In fact, players can add their own goals to any game so the pattern can exist in any game, and is for that reason a possible <style=\"Link\"><link=\"http://virt10.itu.chalmers.se/index.php/Category:Subjective%20Patterns\">Subjective Pattern</link></style> in any game. However, it can be encouraged by providing players with information so they can see that certain series of actions and activities can result in specific outcomes and can therefore be potential <style=\"CurrentLink\">Player-Defined Goals</style>. These <style=\"CurrentLink\">Player-Defined Goals</style> can also <style=\"Link\"><link=\"mutual-goals\">Mutual Goals</link></style> in that several players agree to have them; In contrast, goals that are both <style=\"Link\"><link=\"mutual-goals\">Mutual</link></style> and <style=\"CurrentLink\">Player-Defined</style> and are created through game rules require players to engage in <style=\"Link\"><link=\"http://virt10.itu.chalmers.se/index.php/Negotiation\">Negotiation</link></style> &mdash; especially when a game forces players to create such goals.",
            "<style=\"Link\"><link=\"high-score-lists\">High Score Lists</link></style> is an example of a pattern that can help players defined their own goals since it provides players with the information they need to set up a goal of their own (beating a certain score or getting onto the list). Likewise, a <style=\"Link\"><link=\"http://virt10.itu.chalmers.se/index.php/Game%20State%20Overview\">Game State Overview</link></style> can provide players with sufficient information for them to create their own goals but in this case the overviews can also provides players with continuous information about how close they are to reaching their <style=\"CurrentLink\">Player-Defined Goals</style>. These two patterns help players create their own goals by providing them with information about the current or past game instances, other patterns support the creation of <style=\"CurrentLink\">Player-Defined Goals</style> through the actions they provide. Examples of such patterns include <style=\"Link\"><link=\"betting\">Betting</link></style>, <style=\"Link\"><link=\"bidding\">Bidding</link></style>, <style=\"Link\"><link=\"collecting\">Collecting</link></style>, and <style=\"Link\"><link=\"construction\">Construction</link></style> (the latter when coupled with <style=\"Link\"><link=\"http://virt10.itu.chalmers.se/index.php/Creative%20Control\">Creative Control</link></style>). They do this by providing actions that relate to various game elements but in ways which make thinking of varying amount of these game elements, and this provides opportunities to create goals. Another type of encouragement for <style=\"CurrentLink\">Player-Defined Goals</style> comes through <style=\"Link\"><link=\"player-planned-development\">Player-Planned Development</link></style>. Here the action of planned for future development is in principle setting up goals and while they are perhaps more restricted than the other type of examples they are still defined by players.",
            "Other patterns typically do not conflict with <style=\"CurrentLink\">Player-Defined Goals</style>. Even <style=\"Link\"><link=\"predefined-goals\">Predefined Goals</link></style> does not need to be a problem since they can form a basis upon which other <style=\"CurrentLink\">Player-Defined Goals</style> can be created. One of the few that can be seen as conflicting is <style=\"Link\"><link=\"goal-indicators\">Goal Indicators</link></style> since these draw players' attention to <style=\"Link\"><link=\"predefined-goals\">Predefined Goals</link></style> during gameplay and can therefore draw their attention away from defining goals of their own.",

            "<style=\"CurrentLink\">Player-Defined Goals</style> let players have <style=\"Link\"><link=\"http://virt10.itu.chalmers.se/index.php/Creative%20Control\">Creative Control</link></style> in games and can add <style=\"Link\"><link=\"freedom-choice\">Freedom of Choice</link></style> regarding which goals are available.

If the goals can be changed during gameplay then the goals have <style=\"Link\"><link=\"dynamic-goal-characteristics\">Dynamic Goal Characteristics</link></style> (and <style=\"CurrentLink\">Player-Defined Goals</style> supports this unless the game has a mechanized system in which players need define the goals in relation to the game state).",
            "The goals defined by players are typically <style=\"Link\"><link=\"optional-goals\">Optional Goals</link></style> and, in many cases, also <style=\"Link\"><link=\"ephemeral-goals\">Ephemeral Goals</link></style>.

            "One effect of <style=\"CurrentLink\">Player-Defined Goals</style> is that they can allow players to have closures in <style=\"Link\"><link=\"unwinnable-games\">Unwinnable Games</link></style>.
