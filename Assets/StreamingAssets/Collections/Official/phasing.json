            "Sometimes games do not want to present game worlds in the same way to different players. One reason for this can be that both sides of competing teams are supposed to see themselves as a particular group while another can be that players are to experience that the game world evolves even though it does not for other players. <style=\"CurrentLink\">Phasing</style> is a solution to this that works through either removing the game elements from the presentation of the game to certain players or by showing different game element to different players depending on where they are in specific story arcs of the game.",

Sometimes this is used to remove game elements, e.g. NPCs that give quests that a player has already completed, and sometimes to update the game world according to where a player is in a quest (an example of this is how <i>Acherus: The Ebon Hold</i> changes depending on where in the death knight quest series a player is).",

            "The main design options related to <style=\"CurrentLink\">Phasing</style> is what \"phases\" should exist, how players enter or exit them, and it players share them.
