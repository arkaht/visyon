            "Games often make use of randomness, e.g. through dice or shuffled decks of cards. Computer games make use of algorithms that create sequences of numbers that apparent as random for all practical purposes. These algorithms need an initial number, a seed, to function and games typically provide these automatically; using the current time is a easy solution that provides different numbers each time the game is played. However, some games &mdash; especially those that generate new worlds each time they are played &mdash; allow players to enter these numbers as <style=\"CurrentLink\">Explicit Random Seeds</style> - this makes it possible for players to begin with the same starting position in several different game instances.",
