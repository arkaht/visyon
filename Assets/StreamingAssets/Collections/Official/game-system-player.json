            "Games are constructed around the idea that players will be playing them. In some cases all these players are not humans but either artificial intelligence programs or complex rule sets, but they should still seem to have agency and make actions that seem to have the intent of make that player more likely to win. A <style=\"CurrentLink\">Game System Player</style> is in contrast a player run by the game system with a predictable or at least fixed rule-based behavior that is difficult to interpret as having agency. It can however win over the other players so they need to take the actions of the <style=\"CurrentLink\">Game System Player</style> into consideration while playing.",

Given that each other player has some <i>bank</i> dice, these other players together determine the actions the <i>bank</i> does during a round.

This concern translates into requirements on making the actions it can make easy to perform and making it easy to determine which action it should make.
