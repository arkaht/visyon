            "A majority of games are designed so they end at some point.

            "<style=\"Link\"><link=\"http://virt10.itu.chalmers.se/index.php/Chess\">Chess</link></style> is won by checkmating one's opponent (or making him or her surrender) while <style=\"Link\"><link=\"http://virt10.itu.chalmers.se/index.php/Settlers%20of%20Catan\">Settlers of Catan</link></style> ends as soon as a player can show that he or she has 10 points. <style=\"Link\"><link=\"http://virt10.itu.chalmers.se/index.php/Category:Racing%20Games\">Racing Games</link></style> such as <style=\"Link\"><link=\"http://virt10.itu.chalmers.se/index.php/Formula%20D\">Formula D</link></style>, <style=\"Link\"><link=\"http://virt10.itu.chalmers.se/index.php/Hare%20and%20Tortoise\">Hare and Tortoise</link></style>, <style=\"Link\"><link=\"http://virt10.itu.chalmers.se/index.php/Pachisi\">Pachisi</link></style>, and <style=\"Link\"><link=\"http://virt10.itu.chalmers.se/index.php/Snakes%20and%20Ladders\">Snakes and Ladders</link></style> can be seen as weak examples of <style=\"CurrentLink\">Winning by Ending Gameplay</style> since only the winner may actually have gameplay ended if the other players continue playing to see what positions they got; two-player versions of these games are however strong examples.",

Unlike <style=\"Link\"><link=\"winner-gameplay-ends\">Winner determined after Gameplay Ends</link></style>, <style=\"CurrentLink\">Winning by Ending Gameplay</style> can be applied both to <style=\"Link\"><link=\"multiplayer-games\">Multiplayer Games</link></style> and <style=\"Link\"><link=\"single-player-games\">Single-Player Games</link></style>. ",
            "General examples, to the level that they are patterns, which support <style=\"CurrentLink\">Winning by Ending Gameplay</style> is <style=\"Link\"><link=\"last-man-standing\">Last Man Standing</link></style>, <style=\"Link\"><link=\"races\">Races</link></style>, and games where one wins by having a certain <style=\"Link\"><link=\"scores\">Score</link></style>. The specific choices made regarding the pattern heavily affect how a <style=\"Link\"><link=\"endgame\">Endgame</link></style> plays out if a game has such a gameplay phase.",
            "One design consideration that needs to be taken for the pattern is however if several players can, or should be allowed to, end gameplay simultaneously. <style=\"Link\"><link=\"scores\">Scores</link></style> can be used as <style=\"Link\"><link=\"tiebreakers\">Tiebreakers</link></style> if this is the case and <style=\"Link\"><link=\"tied-results\">Tied Results</link></style> are unwanted.",
            "Due to its definition, <style=\"CurrentLink\">Winning by Ending Gameplay</style> is incompatible with <style=\"Link\"><link=\"unwinnable-games\">Unwinnable Games</link></style> and <style=\"Link\"><link=\"winner-gameplay-ends\">Winner determined after Gameplay Ends</link></style>. However, if <style=\"Link\"><link=\"speedending\">Speedending</link></style> is possible in the latter the combination of these can result in players <style=\"CurrentLink\">Winning by Ending Gameplay</style> (if they judged the game state correctly and managed to end the game instance quickly enough).

The pattern can be used to let players have a chance of ending <style=\"Link\"><link=\"time-limited-game-instances\">Time Limited Game Instances</link></style> prematurely by winning, but can also be used to designate <style=\"Link\"><link=\"tied-results\">Tied Results</link></style> or a <style=\"Link\"><link=\"game-system-player\">Game System Player</link></style> to win if no player has won when time has run out. <style=\"CurrentLink\">Winning by Ending Gameplay</style> creates <style=\"Link\"><link=\"higher-level-closures-gameplay-progresses\">Higher-Level Closures as Gameplay Progresses</link></style> since who wins a game is typically the largest closure in a game instance and <style=\"CurrentLink\">Winning by Ending Gameplay</style> puts this after the end of gameplay,",
