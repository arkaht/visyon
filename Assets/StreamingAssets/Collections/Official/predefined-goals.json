            "<style=\"CurrentLink\">Predefined Goals</style> are preset by the game designer, quite often arranged in a rigid hierarchy, which can only be adaptable by players' choices or interpretations if the design allows it. All winnable games, i.e., games where there exists a game state that defines one or several winners, have the predefined primary goal that can be stated as ''win the game'' but predefined goals that are explicit prerequisite for that game are very common. Other <style=\"CurrentLink\">Predefined Goals</style> are not directly tied to winning a game but helps players through improving the game state in a specific way if they are achieved, and through this help players plan how they should act while playing.

            "How players become aware of <style=\"CurrentLink\">Predefined Goals</style> is another design choice.
