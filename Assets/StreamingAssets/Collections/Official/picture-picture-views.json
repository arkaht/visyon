            "Computer games typically make use of a screen to provide most of the information needed for players to interact with the game system, and typically try to provide a continuous presentation of the game environment on this screen. However, sometimes not all information can be presented while making individual aspects understandable. <style=\"CurrentLink\">Picture-in-Picture Views</style> is a way of solving this, hiding part of the main presentation in order to be able to show some aspect otherwise unavailable. This may be an overview in a game where the main view is typically focused on a small part of the game environment or a close-up in a game where the main view provides an overview.",
