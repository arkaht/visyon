            "Games typically want to keep players engaged in playing them, and one way of doing this is providing closures. However, to continue keeping players engage these closures typically need to become more intense over time. For this reason, many games tend to have structures so to ensure <style=\"CurrentLink\">Higher-Level Closures as Gameplay Progresses</style>.",

            "Games using levels, e.g. the <style=\"Link\"><link=\"http://virt10.itu.chalmers.se/index.php/Portal%20series\">Portal</link></style>, <style=\"Link\"><link=\"http://virt10.itu.chalmers.se/index.php/Super%20Mario%20series\">Super Mario</link></style>, and <style=\"Link\"><link=\"http://virt10.itu.chalmers.se/index.php/Tomb%20Raider%20series\">Tomb Raider series</link></style>, have more challenging ones later in the games. In addition, individual levels typically have more difficult enemies or challenges at the end of them and the overarching narration is typically presented so these move in line with the intensity of the gameplay closures.

            "Ways of achieving <style=\"CurrentLink\">Higher-Level Closures as Gameplay Progresses</style> depend on finding ways of making later closures more important that earlier ones. Since the experience of closures are highly subjective, the pattern is a subjective one and even more so than for other patterns ensuring its presence in game designs typically needs to be verified by play tests. However, using <style=\"Link\"><link=\"closure-points\">Closure Points</link></style> and <style=\"Link\"><link=\"access-rewards\">Access Rewards</link></style> to organize closure possibilities is probably the most general way of causing <style=\"CurrentLink\">Higher-Level Closures as Gameplay Progresses</style> simply by denying players to chance to have some closures before others. <style=\"Link\"><link=\"ever-increasing-difficulty\">Ever Increasing Difficulty</link></style> achieves this more generally, but since the challenges used in such design solutions may be similar to each other this similarity may water down the closure experiences they provide. ",
            "Most generally, <style=\"Link\"><link=\"varying-rule-sets\">Varying Rule Sets</link></style> allow game designs to have more important closures later simply because more important actions and goals can be made only possible to achieve later in the gameplay and successful design of <style=\"Link\"><link=\"challenging-gameplay\">Challenging Gameplay</link></style> throughout a game implies that the challenges have become steadily more difficult and thereby the closures steadily more intense. Slightly less general, the <style=\"Link\"><link=\"endgame\">Endgame</link></style> of a game is where the final effect of all players' efforts are resolved which collect at least some high level closures there and <style=\"Link\"><link=\"goal-hierarchies\">Goal Hierarchies</link></style> let game designs have a structure to the closures, thereby making it possible to put more important ones later in the game. Another example of using <style=\"Link\"><link=\"goal-hierarchies\">Goal Hierarchies</link></style> to provide <style=\"CurrentLink\">Higher-Level Closures as Gameplay Progresses</style> is to let players successively move higher up in <style=\"Link\"><link=\"factions\">Factions</link></style>.<style=\"Link\"><link=\"conditional-passageways\">Conditional Passageways</link></style> allow the structuring of <style=\"CurrentLink\">Higher-Level Closures as Gameplay Progresses</style> through spatial means and related to this, <style=\"Link\"><link=\"boss-monsters\">Boss Monsters</link></style> and <style=\"Link\"><link=\"finale-levels\">Finale Levels</link></style> can be used in level designs in this sense to guarantee greater closures at specific points in the gameplay (and shows how <style=\"CurrentLink\">Higher-Level Closures as Gameplay Progresses</style> can modify <style=\"Link\"><link=\"overcome\">Overcome</link></style> goals).

Due to this, <style=\"CurrentLink\">Higher-Level Closures as Gameplay Progresses</style> appear quite naturally in all games except <style=\"Link\"><link=\"unwinnable-games\">Unwinnable Games</link></style>. <style=\"Link\"><link=\"persistent-game-worlds\">Persistent Game Worlds</link></style> share with <style=\"Link\"><link=\"unwinnable-games\">Unwinnable Games</link></style> that it is difficult to steadily increase the intensity of closure so both these patterns are generally not possible to combine with <style=\"CurrentLink\">Higher-Level Closures as Gameplay Progresses</style>.
