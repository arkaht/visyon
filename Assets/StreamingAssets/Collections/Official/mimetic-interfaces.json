Since the actions need to be physical in some way, <style=\"Link\"><link=\"dexterity-based-actions\">Dexterity-Based Actions</link></style> is a common solution (as seen in <style=\"Link\"><link=\"http://virt10.itu.chalmers.se/index.php/Donkey%20Konga\">Donkey Konga</link></style> and the <style=\"Link\"><link=\"http://virt10.itu.chalmers.se/index.php/Guitar%20Hero%20series\">Guitar Hero series</link></style> being based on playing musical instruments and the <style=\"Link\"><link=\"http://virt10.itu.chalmers.se/index.php/Just%20Dance%20series\">Just Dance series</link></style> requiring players to dance). <style=\"CurrentLink\">Mimetic Interfaces</style> are easily based on <style=\"Link\"><link=\"rhythm-based-actions\">Rhythm-Based Actions</link></style> since presenting rhythms and check that these are being followed is easy to measure. Other types of action can also be the basis for <style=\"CurrentLink\">Mimetic Interfaces</style> but complex activities or those requiring high levels of granularity can be technically challenging to detect. For this reason, many games using <style=\"CurrentLink\">Mimetic Interfaces</style> have rather limited gameplay actions and the pattern may be good to use for <style=\"Link\"><link=\"minigames\">Minigames</link></style> since these can provide variety in theme if nothing else.
