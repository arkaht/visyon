            "Games are often a way to have social activities with others. This does not however always mean that players wish to let other players know much about themselves, e.g. because they are worried about their performance or wish to avoid developing any kind of social relation. To do this, games may give players a <style=\"CurrentLink\">Possibility of Anonymity</style>.",
            "<style=\"H3\">Examples</style>",
            "Players of online games such as the <style=\"Link\"><link=\"http://virt10.itu.chalmers.se/index.php/Battlefield%20series\">Battlefield series</link></style> or the <style=\"Link\"><link=\"http://virt10.itu.chalmers.se/index.php/Left%204%20Dead%20series\">Left 4 Dead series</link></style> can choose what names they want to be identified by, and by not chatting or using voice communications they can keep other players from knowing who they are. The characters created by players of computer-mediated roleplaying games such <style=\"Link\"><link=\"http://virt10.itu.chalmers.se/index.php/Kingdoms\">Kingdoms</link></style>, <style=\"Link\"><link=\"http://virt10.itu.chalmers.se/index.php/Ultima%20Online\">Ultima Online</link></style>, and <style=\"Link\"><link=\"http://virt10.itu.chalmers.se/index.php/World%20of%20Warcraft\">World of Warcraft</link></style> can protect identities in the same fashion, but the effort of maintaining the same alter ego for prolonged period of times usually means that long-time players show their normal selves.",
            "<style=\"H2\">Using the pattern</style>",
            "The trivial solution to providing players with a <style=\"CurrentLink\">Possibility of Anonymity</style> is to make <style=\"Link\"><link=\"single-player-games\">Single-Player Games</link></style>. <style=\"Link\"><link=\"asynchronous-collaborative-actions\">Asynchronous Collaborative Actions</link></style> is also a rather simple solution since players do not need to interact directly.

Quite obviously, this makes the pattern difficult to combine with <style=\"Link\"><link=\"http://virt10.itu.chalmers.se/index.php/Unmediated%20Social%20Interaction\">Unmediated Social Interaction</link></style>. Even when this is avoided, games with mediated <style=\"Link\"><link=\"http://virt10.itu.chalmers.se/index.php/Social%20Interaction\">Social Interaction</link></style> may require players to engage in <style=\"Link\"><link=\"roleplaying\">Roleplaying</link></style> to appear to be somebody they are not if they wish to be anonymous.",
            "Even though it cannot instantiate <style=\"CurrentLink\">Possibility of Anonymity</style> on its own, having support for <style=\"Link\"><link=\"late-arriving-players\">Late Arriving Players</link></style> in games can make it easier since these games cannot rely on all players knowing each others identity.",
            "Since <style=\"Link\"><link=\"public-player-statistics\">Public Player Statistics</link></style> can provide information about players spanning beyond game instances this may ruin players <style=\"CurrentLink\">Possibility of Anonymity</style>. Removing the possibility of players to ''choose'' to be anonymous, the use of <style=\"Link\"><link=\"enforced-player-anonymity\">Enforced Player Anonymity</link></style> works against this pattern while providing some of the same consequences.
