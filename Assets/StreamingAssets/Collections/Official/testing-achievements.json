            "Many computer games offer different ways of playing them, both in regards to which quests to strive toward completing and in regards to which classes or abilities to choose to use. Further, they may offer smaller semi-independent activities that are not necessary to do but offers another type of experience during game sessions. To make it more likely that players test these opportunities and not simply stick to one path, game designers can offer achievements based primarily on the fact that players have tested a quest, class, functionality, or activity.",

            "The action RPG <style=\"Link\"><link=\"http://virt10.itu.chalmers.se/index.php/Torchlight\">Torchlight</link></style> has the achievements <i>Fetch a Fair Price</i>, <i>Shape-Shifter</i>, and <i>Pet Trainer</i> to encourage players to use the functionality their pets provide, while the achievement <i>Mod Squad</i> is rewarded for players installing a mod to the game. <style=\"Link\"><link=\"http://virt10.itu.chalmers.se/index.php/Left%204%20Dead%202\">Left 4 Dead 2</link></style> has a similar <style=\"CurrentLink\">Testing Achievement</style> as <i>Mod Squad</i> through the <i>Mutant Overlord</i> which is given for playing 6 mutations (mods).",
            "Of the many achievements in <style=\"Link\"><link=\"http://virt10.itu.chalmers.se/index.php/World%20of%20Warcraft\">World of Warcraft</link></style>, a few are <style=\"CurrentLink\">Testing Achievements</style>. These include <i>I Found One!</i> for looting a brightly colored egg during the <i>Noblegarden</i> seasonal event, <i>Represent</i> for equipping any tabard, <i>Shave and a Haircut</i> for visiting a barber and getting cosmetic changes to one's avatar, and ",

Although constructing building can be difficult to to enemy interference, helping a team mate construct one to get the <i>Land Grab</i> achievement qualifies as a <style=\"CurrentLink\">Testing Achievements</style> as well since it is not to difficulty to succeed with in well-chosen locations.",

            "<style=\"H2\">Using the pattern</style>",
            "<style=\"CurrentLink\">Testing Achievements</style> are typically designed through selecting some of the optional activities supported by the game, one that might otherwise be overlooked if players are focused on one strategy of completing or winning the game. However, for games with <style=\"Link\"><link=\"varied-gameplay\">Varied Gameplay</link></style> one can construct <style=\"CurrentLink\">Testing Achievements</style> to make players test other ways of playing the game, so these types of <style=\"Link\"><link=\"achievements\">Achievements</link></style> can also be used to encouraged <style=\"Link\"><link=\"varied-gameplay\">Varied Gameplay</link></style> if the difference in gameplay is under  players' choice (rather than the game varying the gameplay between different parts). Even if the required actions by players often are trivially easy in <style=\"CurrentLink\">Testing Achievements</style>, they can be made even easier by awarding them simply for trying - actions do not have to be successfully performed for the achievement to be given. ",
            "What differs <style=\"CurrentLink\">Testing Achievements</style> from <style=\"Link\"><link=\"goal-achievements\">Goal Achievements</link></style> is simply that even if performing the activity could be seen as a goal, it is a trivial goal to succeed with and the main requirement is that the player is willing to try the activity (and does not need to successfully complete it). However, <style=\"CurrentLink\">Testing Achievements</style> and <style=\"Link\"><link=\"goal-achievements\">Goal Achievements</link></style> can be used in pair - the first for trying to perform some activity and the second for showing that one has mastered that specific activity through reaching a non-trivial goal. An example of this is the achievements ''Ol' Buddy Ol' Pal<i> and </i>The Whole Gang's Here'' in <style=\"Link\"><link=\"http://virt10.itu.chalmers.se/index.php/Fallout:%20New%20Vegas\">Fallout: New Vegas</link></style> which are given for having recruited any <style=\"Link\"><link=\"companions\">Companion</link></style> and having recruited all respectively. <style=\"Link\"><link=\"grind-achievements\">Grind Achievements</link></style> may be constructed from requiring players to perform the same activity as one used in a <style=\"Link\"><link=\"http://virt10.itu.chalmers.se/index.php/Testing%20Achievement\">Testing Achievements</link></style> but repeatedly performing it (in practice combining the <style=\"Link\"><link=\"http://virt10.itu.chalmers.se/index.php/Testing%20Achievement\">Testing Achievements</link></style> with a <style=\"Link\"><link=\"http://virt10.itu.chalmers.se/index.php/Collection\">Collections</link></style>).",

            "Like other types of <style=\"Link\"><link=\"achievements\">Achievements</link></style>, <style=\"CurrentLink\">Testing Achievements</style> can be seen as a type of <style=\"Link\"><link=\"rewards\">Reward</link></style> and a basis for <style=\"Link\"><link=\"meta-games\">Meta Games</link></style>. <style=\"CurrentLink\">Testing Achievements</style> can, unlike other types of <style=\"Link\"><link=\"achievements\">Achievements</link></style>, support <style=\"Link\"><link=\"http://virt10.itu.chalmers.se/index.php/Smooth%20Learning%20Curves\">Smooth Learning Curves</link></style> since they can provide motivation to players during the start of engaging in some type activity when players are learning and <style=\"Link\"><link=\"experimenting\">Experimenting</link></style>.",
            "For games with <style=\"Link\"><link=\"varied-gameplay\">Varied Gameplay</link></style>, <style=\"CurrentLink\">Testing Achievements</style> can be used to make players at least test the different ways of playing for a short while. This may promote <style=\"Link\"><link=\"replayability\">Replayability</link></style> and can work against <style=\"Link\"><link=\"grinding\">Grinding</link></style>, but is probably more likely to do so when combined with <style=\"Link\"><link=\"goal-achievements\">Goal Achievements</link></style> to provide <style=\"Link\"><link=\"rewards\">Rewards</link></style> both for beginning to play a certain way and for successfully completing the game or <style=\"Link\"><link=\"quests\">Quest</link></style> in a game by playing a certain way.",

The first case is when <style=\"CurrentLink\">Testing Achievements</style> are combined with <style=\"Link\"><link=\"collections\">Collections</link></style> (subverting the idea of simply testing something once to encouraging it to be tested many times) while the second case occurs when there are too many <style=\"CurrentLink\">Testing Achievements</style> where the activity of testing can become repetitive in itself even if what is tested differs.",
