            "<style=\"H2\">Using the pattern</style>",
            "Several factors affect if a game supports <style=\"CurrentLink\">Negotiable Game Sessions</style>. The two first relate to the variety of length of game sessions supported by the game while still providing a meaningful gameplay experience. The minimum amount of time or actions required of a player can be affected by <style=\"Link\"><link=\"difficulty-levels\">Difficulty Levels</link></style> while <style=\"Link\"><link=\"speedruns\">Speedruns</link></style> make a goal of shortening game sessions but all games have thresholds under which it is difficult to see players being able to have senses of gameplay closure. <style=\"Link\"><link=\"puzzle-solving\">Puzzle Solving</link></style> games with small <style=\"Link\"><link=\"levels\">Levels</link></style> where each level can be seen as its own game, e.g. <style=\"Link\"><link=\"http://virt10.itu.chalmers.se/index.php/Sokoban\">Sokoban</link></style>, probably have the lowest such thresholds. The maximum length of game sessions can quite easily be raised: <style=\"Link\"><link=\"sidequests\">Sidequests</link></style> does it in discrete amounts while <style=\"Link\"><link=\"http://virt10.itu.chalmers.se/index.php/Sandbox%20Gameplay\">Sandbox Gameplay</link></style> opens up for game sessions as long as players can find interesting goals for themselves (<style=\"Link\"><link=\"replayability\">Replayability</link></style> also provides more context to players but between different game sessions). <style=\"Link\"><link=\"time-limits\">Time Limits</link></style> that are set by players is a way to enforce maximum limits to the game sessions and can in this way help support the pattern.",
            "<style=\"Link\"><link=\"negotiable-play-sessions\">Negotiable Play Sessions</link></style> can give rise to <style=\"CurrentLink\">Negotiable Game Sessions</style> when the length of play sessions determine the game session length rather than the overall game session length being static in terms of challenges, <style=\"Link\"><link=\"levels\">Levels</link></style>, or similar measures (but not turns) and play sessions need to add up to this. For example, <style=\"Link\"><link=\"http://virt10.itu.chalmers.se/index.php/Chess\">Chess</link></style> can have <style=\"CurrentLink\">Negotiable Game Sessions</style> since the allowed amount of time for each turn (seen as a play session) can be negotiated.",
            "<style=\"Link\"><link=\"multiplayer-games\">Multiplayer Games</link></style> complicates the issue of having <style=\"CurrentLink\">Negotiable Game Sessions</style> since it either requires that all players can - and do - align their game sessions or that the game system supports unsynchronized game sessions. While this makes basic forms of <style=\"Link\"><link=\"multiplayer-games\">Multiplayer Games</link></style> work against the pattern, <style=\"Link\"><link=\"self-facilitated-games\">Self-Facilitated Games</link></style> and <style=\"Link\"><link=\"drop-in-drop-out\">Drop-In/Drop-Out</link></style> respectively show how these requirements can be supported.",
