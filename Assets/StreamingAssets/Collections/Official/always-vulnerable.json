This is however not so much a question of which particular game system is being used as how game masters handle ",
            "the question of how to treat the characters of players who are missing a session. Some game masters fudge events so that they cannot die (but perhaps do not get as much rewards as the others) while others let them be in the same amount of danger as the characters of present players.",

One is that players' <style=\"Link\"><link=\"focus-loci\">Focus Loci</link></style>, <style=\"Link\"><link=\"investments\">Investments</link></style>, etc. can be threaten when other players have play sessions in the game instance. The other is that all players have their <style=\"Link\"><link=\"characters\">Characters</link></style>, <style=\"Link\"><link=\"units\">Units</link></style>, <style=\"Link\"><link=\"investments\">Investments</link></style>, etc. threatened regardless of if anybody else is playing at all. The first obviously requires <style=\"Link\"><link=\"pvp\">PvP</link></style> gameplay and <style=\"CurrentLink\">Always Vulnerable</style> can be seen as a way of modulating these types of games - it makes most sense in games built around <style=\"Link\"><link=\"cooperation\">Cooperation</link></style> or <style=\"Link\"><link=\"parties\">Parties</link></style> since then the other players (or <style=\"Link\"><link=\"game-masters\">Game Master</link></style>) can more impartially be <style=\"Link\"><link=\"http://virt10.itu.chalmers.se/index.php/Proxy%20Players\">Proxy Players</link></style> (and it may be difficult to find diegetic reasons why the missing player's resources should be safe when other players' resources are not).
